title: Working with Local Data
date: 2014-09-19

In this module we will learn:

1. to create a new script file and load in our JSON data
2. to select data from particular fields and deal with missing data
3. to convert our JSON data to strings of text

Now that we have a very large file of JSON data, we can work locally to find patterns that we could not find using the online interface for the DPLA's holdings. Because we are interested in the language being used in order to investigate how the descriptions of "cooking" items are gendered, our next step is to filter down that data and save it as text. In the next module, we will use the Natural Language ToolKit, a powerful Python library for working with text, to find patterns in the text data.

### 1. Create a New Script and Load in Our Data

It is time to create a new script file!

Go to Terminal and type:

	touch my_second_script.py 

or on Windows: 

    New-Item -ItemType file my_second_script.py

To open your new script file, type:

	open my_second_script.py

or on Windows:

    Start notepad++ my_second_script.py

First, we will need the JSON library again. To add this, add <span class="command">import json</span> to the very top of the file.

    # Load Libraries
    import json

The next thing is to load up the data from our "search_results.json" file.

The structure for this is:
    
    # Set Variables
    with open("search_results.json") as json_file:
        json_data = json.load(json_file)

Here, we tell Python to "open" our "search_results.json" file and assign it to the variable "json_file". The we use the "load" method in the "json.library" to load up the data and save it as the variable "json_data". 

Our second script file should now look like:

    # Load Libraries
    import json

    # Set Variables
    with open("search_results.json") as json_file:
        json_data = json.load(json_file) 

    # Define Functions

    # Make Function Calls  


To make sure this worked, let's print out one item from the JSON data. Work with your table to add a "print" statement that prints the second item in the json_data list.

### 2. Select the Relevant Text Data

The next step is to select the fields that will be most helpful for analyzing how "cooking" items are described across the items in the DPLA.

Looking at our items, there are three main fields containing description-type information for our different "cooking" items: the title, the description, and the subject headings. 

Our question for these items is how, across the entire DPLA collection, the descriptions of items related to cooking are gendered. To pursue this question, we need to do some basic text analysis, so let's save our search results in a format that makes it easy to do that: as text.

To start, let's make a new function called "get_text" that takes in our "json_data" list:

    # Define Functions
    def get_text(json_data):
        # Do something to each item in json_data

Next, for each item in that array, we want to look for the "title", the "description", and the "subject heading fields". This means using another "for loop". 

    # Define Functions    
    def get_text(json_data):
        for each in json_data:
            # Get the titles
            # Get the descriptions
            # Get the subject headings

We can get the title, description, and subject headings by looking for those "keys" within each item in our "json_data" list. 

    # Define Functions    
    def get_text(json_data):
        for each in json_data:
            # Get the title
            find_titles = each['sourceResource']['title']

            # Get the Description
            find_descriptions = each['sourceResource']['description']

            # Get the Subject Headings
            find_subjects = each['sourceResource']['subject']

So far so good. But what if one of these fields is missing? Programming languages are very literal -- if you tell it to do something that it cannot do, it just stops and gives you an error. To see this in action, let's add a line in 'Make Function Calls' to call the function.

    # Load Libraries
    import json

    # Set Variables
    with open("search_results.json") as json_file:
        json_data = json.load(json_file) 

    # Define Functions
    def get_text(json_data):
        for each in json_data:
            # Get the Titles
            find_titles = each['sourceResource']['title']

            # Get the Descriptions
            find_descriptions = each['sourceResource']['description']

            # Get the Subject Headings
            find_subjects = each['sourceResource']['subject']

    # Make Function Calls
    print json_data[1]
    get_text(json_data)

Towards the end of the error message, you should see a line that says "KeyError: 'sourceResource.description'". This is Python telling you that it cannot find a key "title" in one of the resources.

To deal with this, we use "try" and "except" -- we will tell the computer to try to find the keys, but if it doesn't, to assign the value to an empty space and move on.

    # Define Functions
    def get_text(json_data):
        for each in json_data:
            # Get the Titles
            try:
                find_titles = each['sourceResource']['title']
            except:
                title = ' '
            
            # Get the Descriptions
            try:
                find_descriptions = each['sourceResource']['description']
            except:
                description = ' '

            # Get the Subject Headings
            try:
                find_subjects = each['sourceResource']['subject']
            except:
                subject = ' '

There are two more steps we need to get the text ready to save. The first step is to get all of the data out of lists and make sure that it is in the form of a string.

    # Define Functions
    def get_text(json_data):
        for each in json_data:
            # Get the Titles
            try:
                find_titles = each['sourceResource']['title']
                if isinstance(find_titles, basestring):
                    title = find_titles.encode('utf8')
                else:
                    for each in find_titles:
                        title = each.encode('utf8')
            except:
                title = ' '
            
            # Get the Descriptions
            try:
                find_descriptions = each['sourceResource']['description']
                if isinstance(find_descriptions, basestring):
                    description = find_descriptions.encode('utf8')
                else:
                    for each in find_descriptions:
                        description = each.encode('utf8')
            except:
                description = ' '

            # Get the Subject Headings
            try:
                find_subjects = each['sourceResource']['subject']
                if isinstance(find_subjects, basestring):
                    subject = find_subjects.encode('utf8')
                else:
                    subject_list = []
                    for each in find_subjects:
                        subject_list.append(each['name'])  

                    combined_subjects = ', '.join(subject_list)
                    subject = combined_subjects.encode('utf8')
            except:
                subject = ' '

You might notice two odd things with this function. First, we are reusing variable names. Variables hold the last thing passed to them, so we can overwrite the value of a variable to update it as we go along. 

Second, we are handling the subject field differently than title and description. This is because the subject key holds an additional list, rather than just values. Work in your groups to map out what is going on in the subject section of the funciton.

The last is to save this data into a text file. Similar to last time, we need to set up the file that will receive that data:
    
    # Load Libraries
    import json

    # Set Variables
    with open("search_results.json") as json_file:
        json_data = json.load(json_file) 
    
    f = open('text_results.txt', 'w')

The major difference here is that we are opening the file as append so that we can save each line of data as we loop, rather than storing it all and writing it all at once.

Our whole file should now look like this:

    # Load Libraries
    import json

    # Set Variables
    with open("search_results.json") as json_file:
        json_data = json.load(json_file)

    f = open('text_results.txt', 'w')

    # Define Functions
    def get_text(json_data):
        for each in json_data:
            # Get the Titles
            try:
                find_titles = each['sourceResource']['title']
                if isinstance(find_titles, basestring):
                    title = find_titles.encode('utf8')
                else:
                    for each in find_titles:
                        title = each.encode('utf8')
            except:
                title = ' '
            
            # Get the Descriptions
            try:
                find_descriptions = each['sourceResource']['description']
                if isinstance(find_descriptions, basestring):
                    description = find_descriptions.encode('utf8')
                else:
                    for each in find_descriptions:
                        description = each.encode('utf8')
            except:
                description = ' '

            # Get the Subject Headings
            try:
                find_subjects = each['sourceResource']['subject']
                if isinstance(find_subjects, basestring):
                    subject = find_subjects.encode('utf8')
                else:
                    subject_list = []
                    for each in find_subjects:
                        subject_list.append(each['name'])  

                    combined_subjects = ', '.join(subject_list)
                    subject = combined_subjects.encode('utf8')
            except:
                subject = ' '

Now, let's go back to the function and put all our pieces together into a new variable.

    # Define Functions
    def get_text(json_data):
        for each in json_data:
            # Get the Titles
            try:
                find_titles = each['sourceResource']['title']
                if isinstance(find_titles, basestring):
                    title = find_titles.encode('utf8')
                else:
                    for each in find_titles:
                        title = each.encode('utf8')
            except:
                title = ' '
            
            # Get the Descriptions
            try:
                find_descriptions = each['sourceResource']['description']
                if isinstance(find_descriptions, basestring):
                    description = find_descriptions.encode('utf8')
                else:
                    for each in find_descriptions:
                        description = each.encode('utf8')
            except:
                description = ' '

            # Get the Subject Headings
            try:
                find_subjects = each['sourceResource']['subject']
                if isinstance(find_subjects, basestring):
                    subject = find_subjects.encode('utf8')
                else:
                    subject_list = []
                    for each in find_subjects:
                        subject_list.append(each['name'])  

                    combined_subjects = ', '.join(subject_list)
                    subject = combined_subjects.encode('utf8')
            except:
                subject = ' '

            # Combine the data into a single variable in the form of a sentence
            data = title + '; ' + description + '; ' + subject + '. \n'

This line takes the information held in title, adds a ";" and a space, takes the information in description, add '; and a space, and finally, takes the list held in subject and smashes it together into a string, separated by a comman and a space. Finally, the "\n" adds an "enter" the end of the line, so that the information for each item appears on a new line.

The last step is to write all the information within "data" to our file.

    # Define Functions
    def get_text(json_data):
        for each in json_data:
            # Get the Titles
            try:
                find_titles = each['sourceResource']['title']
                if isinstance(find_titles, basestring):
                    title = find_titles.encode('utf8')
                else:
                    for each in find_titles:
                        title = each.encode('utf8')
            except:
                title = ' '
            
            # Get the Descriptions
            try:
                find_descriptions = each['sourceResource']['description']
                if isinstance(find_descriptions, basestring):
                    description = find_descriptions.encode('utf8')
                else:
                    for each in find_descriptions:
                        description = each.encode('utf8')
            except:
                description = ' '

            # Get the Subject Headings
            try:
                find_subjects = each['sourceResource']['subject']
                if isinstance(find_subjects, basestring):
                    subject = find_subjects.encode('utf8')
                else:
                    subject_list = []
                    for each in find_subjects:
                        subject_list.append(each['name'])  

                    combined_subjects = ', '.join(subject_list)
                    subject = combined_subjects.encode('utf8')
            except:
                subject = ' '

            # Combine the data into a single variable in the form of a sentence
            data = title + '; ' + description + '; ' + subject + '. \n'

            # Write the sentence to the 'text_results' file
            f.write(data)

Now let's add a call to the function and run our code:
    
    # Load Libraries
    import json

    # Set Variables
    with open("search_results.json") as json_file:
        json_data = json.load(json_file)

    f = open('text_results.txt', 'w')

    # Define Functions
    def get_text(json_data):
        for each in json_data:
            # Get the Titles
            try:
                find_titles = each['sourceResource']['title']
                if isinstance(find_titles, basestring):
                    title = find_titles.encode('utf8')
                else:
                    for each in find_titles:
                        title = each.encode('utf8')
            except:
                title = ' '
            
            # Get the Descriptions
            try:
                find_descriptions = each['sourceResource']['description']
                if isinstance(find_descriptions, basestring):
                    description = find_descriptions.encode('utf8')
                else:
                    for each in find_descriptions:
                        description = each.encode('utf8')
            except:
                description = ' '

            # Get the Subject Headings
            try:
                find_subjects = each['sourceResource']['subject']
                if isinstance(find_subjects, basestring):
                    subject = find_subjects.encode('utf8')
                else:
                    subject_list = []
                    for each in find_subjects:
                        subject_list.append(each['name'])  

                    combined_subjects = ', '.join(subject_list)
                    subject = combined_subjects.encode('utf8')
            except:
                subject = ' '

            # Combine the data into a single variable in the form of a sentence
            data = title + '; ' + description + '; ' + subject + '. \n'

            # Write the sentence to the 'text_results' file
            f.write(data)

    # Make Function Calls
    get_text(json_data)

Save and run your second python script. You should now have a text file named "text_results.txt" in your directory. If you open that file, you should see lines of beautiful text ready for analysis.

In the next module, we will use the Natural Language ToolKit, a powerful Python library for working with text, to find patterns in the text data.
