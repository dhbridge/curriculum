Factors Influencing Shopping, Cooking, and Eating Behaviors Among Low-Income Families During a One-Month Period of Time; Objective: To evaluate changes in shopping behaviors among low-income families over a one-month period of time in Utah County, Utah. Design: Two researchers conducted thirteen 90-minute focus groups. Setting: Two community organizations serving low-income populations and a university campus. Participants: Seventy-two low-income adults who were the primary household food shoppers and who had at least one child less than 18 years in their household. Main Outcome Measures: Shopping behavior changes during one month period of time. Analysis: Focus groups were recorded and transcribed, and then coded independently by two researchers with any differences reconciled. Paired t-tests were used to test differences of food expenditures by food group between the beginning and end-of-the-month shopping behaviors. Results: Shopping habits among low-income families changed throughout the month and were impacted by use of food assistance programs, food prices, and shopping logistics. Participants reported purchasing more varied foods at the beginning of the month versus more starch-based and canned foods at the end-of-the-month. To overcome economic barriers, participants used numerous strategies including weekly or monthly menu planning, price matching, and bulk buying. Conclusions and Implications: Low-income families make strategic decisions based on economic circumstances and other factors, including participation in food assistance programs, or the timing of the month, in order to stretch food expenditures. Our results suggest limited economics throughout the month may hinder families’ ability to consume a varied, nutrient-rich diet, which may impact future health status.;  .

Typewriters and cooking smells: associated sensibilites in Samuel Taylor Coleridge, T.S. Eliot, and Jorie Graham; Typewriters and Cooking Smells: The Associated Sensibilities of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, T. S. Eliot, and Jorie Graham" examines theories of the poetic imagination. Positing a connection between critical thinking and emotional feeling, this dissertation examines how poetry is created by an organic blending of the two. Looking in particular at poets who are invested in the intersection of philosophy and poetry, the dissertation argues that when poetry is being made, poets engage in a particular kind of thinking; usefully, it has been called "lyric thinking" by the scholar Robert Von Hallberg. The dissertation explores lyric thinking through the periods of Romanticism, Modernism and Postmodernism, thus considering how cultural, historical, and theoretical changes have impacted poetic creation. Coleridge's notions of the Primary and Secondary Imagination are used as key concepts for understanding early theories of the imagination; his idea of the "esemplastic" is also a critical term for the dissertation. A genealogy is then traced from Coleridge to Eliot through to Graham, looking at how the Romantic understanding of how the imagination functions continues to affect poets today. Eliot's idea of dissociation of sensibility is also central to the argument; the dissertation avers that, contra Eliot, in true instances of poetic creation, there is no dissociation of sensibility. Rather, an absolute association of thought and feeling occur. The dissertation comprises a critical thesis and a creative manuscript; the creative manuscript, titled The Sleep Hotel, is contained as an appendix. The poems in the manuscript address many of the same issues as the critical thesis: they are metapoetic, attempting to trace the mind in the act of making the poem.;  .

Cooking oil, dietary fat, fat metabolizing genes, and prostate cancer risk in a multiethnic population; Dietary fat has been implicated as a potential promotional factor leading to progression of small, latent, non-metastatic prostate tumors to invasive, metastatic lesions. One possible mechanism is conversion of the inflammatory compounds of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) produced by the lipoxygenase (LOX) family of enzymes. PUFAs are found in many cooking oils, such as soybean, safflower, and sunflower. Furthermore, foods such as avocado, nuts, cereals, and poultry are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. The effect of cooking oil has not been extensively investigated, however, there is evidence of a relationship between dietary patterns and prostate cancer (Stacewicz-Sapuntzakis, 2008). We had three objectives: to examine the effects of dietary fat intake, type of cooking oil used, and whether genetic variants in the PUFA LOX pathways are associated with the risk of prostate cancer. We conducted a population-based case control study of advanced prostate cancer among African-Americans and Caucasians in Los Angeles County. Dietary fat intake and preferred cooking oil were assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. To assess genetic variants, five LOX gene polymorphisms were examined: 12-LOX Gln261Arg (rs434473), and Ser322Asn (rs1126667), 15-LOX-2 Gln656Arg (rs4792147), 5-LOX Lys254Glu (rs4073259), and the 5-LOX promoter Sp1 motif polymorphism. ❧ We observed a statistically significant association between preferred cooking oil and risk of prostate cancer at all stages. Men, regardless of race, who used vegetable or corn oil, but not hydrogenated fat, were 1.83 times as likely to experience prostate cancer than men who used olive or canola oil; those who used hydrogenated oils were 1.57 times as likely to experience prostate cancer. Similar results were observed among men with localized or advanced stage prostate cancer. ❧ When we evaluated the risks isolated to a particular stage of prostate cancer, we observed that men who use vegetable or corn oil, but not hydrogenated fat, were 1.72 times as likely to experience localized prostate cancer than men who used olive or canola oil, and those who used hydrogenated oils were 1.59 times as likely to experience localized prostate cancer. Furthermore, we observe that men who used vegetable or corn oil, but not hydrogenated fat, were 1.87 times as likely to experience advanced stage prostate cancer than men who used olive or canola oil, and those who used hydrogenated oils were 1.50 times as likely to experience advanced stage prostate cancer. ❧ Among Caucasians, men who used vegetable or corn oil, but not hydrogenated fat, were 2.08 times as likely to experience prostate cancer than men who used olive or canola oil, and those who used hydrogenated oils were 1.53 times as likely. Among African-Americans, there was an increased risk, but it was not as significant as among Caucasians. ❧ We did not observe a statistically significant relationship between PUFA and risk when not taking genotype into account. A statistically significant interaction was observed between 12-LOX Gln261Arg and PUFA (p=0.04). Among African-American men with the GG genotype, there was a decrease in risk of prostate cancer with PUFA intake below the median PUFA consumption. Caucasian men with the AA genotype displayed an increase in risk with diets high in PUFAs. Furthermore, we saw a statistically significant interaction between 12-LOX Ser322Asn and PUFA (p=0.02). Among African-American men with diets low in PUFAs, there was a decrease in risk.;  .

Representation of 'ideal image in woman' in Martha Stewart and Harumi Kurihara's cooking magazines; Master of Arts; Even though there are many studies on domestic advice experts, the total coordination of lifestyle, and the images of women promoted through commercialized domesticity, there has been comparatively little research into the relationship between domesticity and women's images in different cultures, particularly through cooking magazines. In this thesis, I will compare two periodicals, Martha Stewart's Martha Stewart Living (MSL) and Harumi Kurihara's haru_mi in order to examine how Stewart and Kurihara convey their images of homemaker through their magazines, how and why they are different (such as cultural, linguistic, social, and economic factors) and the kinds of messages they send to their readers. In order to answer these questions, the following issues will be discussed: 1) the historical background of women in society in both the U.S. and Japan, with a focus on changes in the roles of women in society during 1960s to 1990s, 2) how Stewart and Kurihara manipulate their images as homemakers in their magazines in order to promote not only the lifestyles they suggest but more so for their products, and 3) the kinds of influences Stewart and Kurihara have had on their readers through magazines and their products.;  .

Julia Child; Until well into her thirties, Julia Child had never given much thought to food. In 1948, however, with her husband stationed in Paris, she began taking classes at France's Cordon Bleu cooking school, and suddenly her husband was declaring himself a "Cordon Bleu widower." With two French friends she started a cooking school and began collaborating with them on Mastering the Art of French Cooking, which is still considered one of the finest American books on French cuisine. Child's career as a cooking expert had yet to reach its full bloom, however. In 1963, she made her debut as The French Chef on public television. Speaking in a high, chirpy voice, she made mistakes and dropped food. But audiences loved her as much for her frailties as for her expertise, and by the late 1960s she had clearly become a significant force in shaping America's dietary mores.;  .

James Beard; Long before it became fashionable, noted chef and cookbook author James Beard was an unapologetic champion of the virtues of American cuisine. Introduced to good eating by his mother, who was an excellent cook, Beard opened an upscale catering business in New York City in 1938 after his dreams of a stage career failed to materialize. In 1940 he published Hors d’Oeuvre and Canapés—the first of more than twenty cookbooks he would author—and in 1946 he gained a national following as the host of network television’s first cooking show, which aired on NBC. Widely recognized as "America’s chef" in the decades that followed, Beard achieved bestseller status with such titles as James Beard’s Cookbook (1959) and James Beard’s American Cookery (1972). In assessing Beard’s culinary legacy, Julia Child observed, "When one thinks of American cooking, well, he started it. He popularized cooking and made people comfortable at the stove.;  .

Microwave Egg Cooker; Julia Child, the beloved American cooking teacher, cookbook author, and television personality, was a self-described “gadget freak.” She collected kitchen tools throughout her long career and received many gadgets as gifts from friends and colleagues. The origin and actual use of this egg cooker is unknown, but, since Julia’s kitchen did not include a microwave oven in 2001, it is safe to assume she kept the microwave egg cooker for some reason other than to use it for cooking one egg at a time.;  .

Qualitative Description of College Students' Dinner Groups; Objective: The purpose of this study was to discover how college students conduct dinner groups and students' perceptions of the benefits and difficulties of participation. Design: Qualitative study conducted with seven focus groups. Setting: A university campus. Participants: Thirty-six college students participating in dinner groups. Dinner groups were defined as a group of ≥3 people cooking for each other (or together) and eating together ≥4 times a week. Analysis: The focus groups were recorded, transcribed, coded, and reconciled. NUDISTNVivos oftware was used in identifying themes and subthemes. Results: Dinner groups were composed of roommates and/or other students living nearby. They rotated who made each dinner. Benefits identified included social interaction, increasing confidence in cooking, saving money and time, and eating more varied and healthier foods. Difficulties were mentioned but were much less common. They included increased time spent on days the student cooked and stresses related to cooking on a schedule. Students found that the benefits far outweighed the difficulties and universally wanted to continue in a dinner group. Conclusions and Implications: College students enjoy dinner groups and promoting them may be an option for improving college students’ eating habits. Nearly all students felt that they ate better in a dinner group but research is needed to assess actual intake.;  .

Julia Child; With the 1961 publication of her groundbreaking Mastering the Art of French Cooking (co-authored with Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle), Julia Child launched a highly successful effort to demystify French cuisine by enabling American cooks "to create French dishes in American kitchens with American foods." The book sold more than 100,000 copies in its first year and also provided the springboard to Child’s improbable career in television. In February 1962, just four months after her cookbook’s release, Child appeared on a local interview program on WGBH in Boston and matter-of-factly prepared a mushroom omelet. Viewers were enchanted, and letters poured in asking for more opportunities to see Child in action. The result was the debut, on July 26, 1962, of The French Chef—the half-hour cooking show on public television that would make Julia Child a household name and a culinary icon.;  . 
Julia Child; In 1966, when Julia Child appeared on the cover of Time, she was enjoying the zenith of her long career as a chef and bestselling author. Her first book, Mastering the Art of French Cooking (1961), had become a popular classic. When the cover story appeared, Child was hosting a half-hour Emmy-winning program, The French Chef, which aired on public television. The show was popular with cooks and non-cooks alike chiefly because of Child’s appealing and unflappable personality. Her legions of loyal fans loved her adventures and misadventures in the kitchen. Yet at least two readers of Time took issue with her cover portrait, which Chaliapin had made from life sketches. According to one critic, Child’s head, framed with copper pots, cooking utensils, and a fish, "resembles the First Apparition in Shakespeare’s Macbeth.;  .

National Rice Cooker & Steamer; Electric rice cookers were developed in Japan after World War I, and by the late 1950’s, such cookers were a standard appliance in Japanese homes. Their manufacture and use spread throughout the rest of Asia where rice was the dietary mainstay, and then to the rest of the world where rice-eating continued to grow over the next years of global contact, trade, and culinary exchange. The rice cookers, which, unlike cooking over a flame or electric coil, guarantee perfectly cooked, non-burnt rice every time. The early rice cookers operated via a double chamber with a thermostat-controlled cooking temperature that shut off the heat when the rice was done. Later cookers like this one incorporated increasingly user-friendly technologies, such as a non-stick inner chamber and a stay-warm function. Later cooking processes were governed by microprocessors.;  .

Ensuring Microbial Safety in Food Product/Process Development: Alternative Processing of Meat Products and Pathogen Survival in Low-Salt Cheddar Cheese; Most outbreaks of foodborne illness in the United States occur as a result of improper food-handling and preparation practices in homes or food establishments. Some food-safety recommendations that are difficult to incorporate into handling and cooking procedures have contributed to a gap between food-safety knowledge and the actual behavior. The first part (Chapter 3, 4) of this study sought to ensure microbial safety by establishing alternative processing of meat products that can be easily practiced by food-operators and consumers. In Chapter 3, a novel method was developed to thaw frozen chicken-breast by submersion in hot water at 60 °C, an appropriate temperature setting for foodservice hot-holding equipment. This method is rapid (compared to either refrigerator or cold-water thawing that also uses a significant amount of water), safe, and the final cooked-product sensory-quality was not different from refrigerator-thawed and cooked product (microwave thawing results in localized overheating). Chapter 4 developed marinade-cooking (91 °C) and holding (60 °C) procedures for hamburger-patties. Frozen patties were partially grilled and finished cooking in marinade. The moderate temperature of marinade cooking overcomes the chances of thick-patties being surface-overcooked while innermost portions remain undercooked as seen in high-temperature cooking methods (grilling and pan-frying). Consumers liked the marinade-finished cooked and held patties (up to 4 h) equally or more (holding-time dependent) compared to patties grilled and held in a hot-steam cabinet. Reducing salt in perishable foods including cheese is microbial-safety concern especially in their distribution and storage. The second part (Chapter 5, 6) of this study sought to evaluate microbial safety of low-salt hard-type cheese. Aged Cheddar cheeses were inoculated with either Listeria monocytogenes (3.5 log CFU/g) or Salmonella spp. (4.0 log CFU/g) and their survival or growth was monitored at 4, 10, and 21°C for up to 90, 90, and 30 d, respectively. Low-salt (0.7% NaCl) Cheddar formulated at pH 5.1 or 5.7 exhibited no-growth or gradual reduction in L. monocytogenes and Salmonella counts. The results suggest that low-salt Cheddar is as safe as its full-salt counterparts (1.8% NaCl) and that salt may only be a minor food-safety hurdle regarding the post-aging contamination and growth of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella.; Microbial safety, Processing, Meat, Pathogen survival, Cheddar cheese, Nutrition.

Diploma from Le Cordon Bleu, 1951; In 1949, Julia enrolled in the 10-month program at Le Cordon Bleu, along with eleven American veterans who wanted to become professional chefs. The U.S. Government paid the veterans’ tuition and, by virtue of her work for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during the war, Julia’s tuition was covered as well. As the only woman in her class, Julia was a rarity, but she threw herself into the training and carried out the rigorous work, completing the program in 1950. Because of ill will between Madame Brassart and Julia, however, the diploma was not awarded until a year later and after the intervention of Max Bugnard. Julia Child went on to become America’s influential and beloved cooking teacher, cookbook author, and television chef.;  .

Interior of Ernest Shackleton's hut, Antarctica, 1981; Interior of Ernest Shackleton's hut, Antarctica, 1981. Wooden shelves contain food stuffs and table and cooking ware.; Ernest Shackleton was a member of Robert Scott's initial voyage to Antarctica. Determined to reach the pole, he returned to the region in 1907 and set up a base camp near Mount Erebus. He and his three companions got to within 97 miles of their destination but were forced to turn back due to poor weather conditions and a lack of food. While Shackleton traveled south, some of his remaining men climbed Mount Erebus for the first time. Shackleton's Hut is preserved today (2002) in much the same condition as his crew left it, almost 100 years ago.;  .

Fright Knife; Julia Child called this 20-inch-long knife, with its serrated, stainless steel blade and rosewood handle, her “fright” knife. She wielded it in several of her early, televised cooking shows to great comic effect, memorably tapping each of the “Chicken Sisters” with its blade (“Miss Broiler! Miss Fryer! Miss Roaster! Miss Caponette! Miss Stewer! And Old Madame Hen!”) in a 1970 episode of The French Chef. A self-avowed “knife freak,” Julia accumulated a large collection of kitchen knives, and this one became a favorite prop for getting viewers’ attention on television.;  .

Julia Child's Pyrex Measuring Cup; To determine volume, weight, temperature, and time, cooks use measuring cups and spoons (for liquids and dry ingredients), thermometers of all sorts for the oven, freezer, or deep-fat fryer; for chocolate, dough, meat, candy, and jelly; scales for liquids and solids; salometers or hydrometers to test the density of a salt or sugar solution; and timers. The well-known cookbook author and television cooking show star Julia Child had a number of the most commonly used American kitchen measuring devices in her kitchen. Now in the collections of the National Museum of American History, Julia's Pyrex glass one- and two- cup measures, are marked in both English measurements (1 cup; 8 oz.) and in metric (250 ml).;  .

Graves Guest Ranch; Edward and Mary Graves bought the Underhill property on the northwest corner of Indian School and Scottsdale Roads circa 1910, calling it Graves Guest Ranch. It catered to winter visitors as well as those who had come to the dry Arizona climate to restore their health. As shown in the photo, the cottages were part wood frame and part canvas. Meals were included with a guests' stay, and the Graves Ranch dining room had a great reputation for good old-fashioned home cooking. Many guests, after enjoying a season at the Graves Guest Ranch, and perhaps enjoying improved health, opted to become Scottsdale residents.; Photographs--Scottsdale (Ariz.)--History, Photography--Scottsdale (Ariz.)--History, Scottsdale (Ariz.)--History--Photographs, Graves, Edward, Graves, Mary, Graves Guest Ranch, Arts and architecture, Business and industry, Leisure and travel, Society and culture. 
Walsh & Hoyt: Toxoplasmosis: Prevention; Preventive measures to minimize human contact with infectious forms of T. gondii are important in controlling both acquired and congenital forms of toxoplasmosis. Adequately cooking meat kills the tissue cysts and prevents this form of transmission. All persons, but particularly pregnant women and immunosuppressed patients, should use care in handling raw meat, raw vegetables, cats and their litter boxes, and contaminated soil. Eggs should not be eaten raw, and unpasteurized milk should be avoided. Sandboxes should be kept covered when not in use, and cat litter pans should be cleaned every day to avoid sporulation of oocysts. Gloves should be worn while disposing of cat litter material, working in the garden, or cleaning a child�s sandbox.; Infectious Diseases, Protozoa, Protozoal Diseases, Toxoplasma Condii, Toxoplasmosis, Prevention.

Copper bowl, about 1950; Copper bowls, unlike their stove-bound relatives, are unlined, and it is the somewhat scientifically demonstrated belief of chefs who use them that the interaction of air with agitation on copper produces fluffier and airier eggs than any other cooking material. With their legendary ability to conduct heat evenly, the copper pots, most tin-lined (and re-lined over and again), reflect cooking methods typical for the French food Julia taught America to appreciate. Modern copper pots are typically lined with stainless steel, and many may have a copper-over-aluminum bottom to further create an even heat.;  .

Haddock; These slippery haddock are fresh from the sea and ready for cooking. Emil Carlsen's painting is one in a series of still lifes showing game, fish, and household utensils. The artist was inspired by the eighteenth-century French painter Jean Simeon Chardin, whose paintings he saw during a six-month stay in Paris in the late 1870s.

Pottery Piece; This pottery shard is from an everyday pot which was found in the pithouse at the Deer Valley Rock Art Center and was most likely used for cooking. The Hohokam developed red on buff pottery. The ceramic materials used to create the pots consisted of clay and temper. In the Southwest, temper consists of sand, crushed or ground rock, and crushed potsherds. These materials were coiled into the desired shape and smoothed by using the paddle and anvil technique. Decorations consisted of specific designs marked or painted onto the pottery. Paint was derived from plant or mineral pigments found in the surrounding environment. The kind of temper and designs used in pottery making can often distinguish pottery made by different groups or cultures within an area.; Rock art--Arizona, Sacred sites, Petroglyphs, Arts and architecture, Society and culture, Religion and philosophy, Native Americans.

Arsenic in Ground Water of the Willamette Basin, Oregon; Arsenic concentrations exceeding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) current Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 50 mg/L (micrograms per liter) are widespread in ground water in the Willamette Basin. The Oregon Water Resources Department and the U.S. Geological Survey began a cooperative study in the Willamette Basin in 1996. One goal of this study is to characterize the regional distribution of naturally occurring poor-quality ground water, such as ground water with high concentrations of arsenic. Characterization of the regional distribution of arsenic concentrations in the Willamette Basin will be useful to public health officials, water-resource managers, the medical community, and those using ground water for drinking and cooking.; Groundwater, Water--Analysis, Water--Pollution--Toxicology, Water--Purification--Arsenic removal, Portland (Or.), Oregon.

Chef’s Jacket, Emeril Lagasse; Emeril appeared with Julia Child on her program Cooking with Master Chefs, and the episode, which featured a crab and crawfish boil, was a hit. Producers thought Emeril’s culinary talents and ease in front of the camera would make him an ideal host on the Television Food Network, which launched in 1993. His first show, How to Boil Water, was designed for viewers new to cooking. During the show Emeril read from a script, following the existing format of educational public television programs. The show was unsuccessful, and in response the Food Network re-imagined the type of programming it would broadcast, placing Emeril at the center of this transformation. New programming, like Emeril Live, relied on the host’s personality to win over audiences. With a signature slogan of, “Bam!,” a studio audience full of fans and a live band, Emeril Live represented the beginning of a new era of food television, and a model for future Food Network programs.;  .

IN-N-OUT Lap Mat, 1976; Eating in the car quickly caught on in the United States and IN-N-OUT’s decision in 1961 to offer customers paper “lap mats” to protect their clothing reflects the popularity of the practice. Harry Snyder began hand cutting the brown paper used by bakeries for packaging buns into rectangular mats. He soon switched to pink butcher paper thinking it would make dashboard dining a more enjoyable experience. When a printing company contacted Snyder in 1971 about replacing the butcher paper with printed lap mats, Snyder saw an opportunity to provide consumers with more information. Early versions of the lap mats featured maps of the local area and information on other IN-N-Out Burger locations. By the 25th anniversary in 1973, IN-N-Out Burger had 13 restaurants in Los Angeles County, all featuring a two-lane drive-thru and a limited amount of outdoor seating. In 1979, IN-N-Out opened its first single lane drive-thru facility with a large open dining room, a design that became the model for future expansion. In 2012, IN-N-OUT Burger had 281 locations in California, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, and Utah and remains a popular destination for both locals and tourists who want to eat on the go.;  . 
Mano; Manos and metates are stone grinding tools. They were used to grind maize, beans, cotton seeds, and other wild grains and seeds.This mano was found at the Hedgpeth Hills. It was hand-shaped by a skilled craftsman with the use of a cobble hammerstone. Many mano and metate blanks were found at the site, along with andesite debris chipped away from the blanks while shaping. The hand-held mano is slid horizontally across the metate to process materials. In order to produce the fine flour used for cooking, three separate grinding processes may have taken place: first to bruise and rough-grain; second to grind into a finer texture; and third to grind into the texture of flour. This complete process would have taken several hours and several people to complete. Manos and metates are still used today as grinding tools in various regions of the Southwest and Mexico.; Rock art--Arizona, Sacred sites, Petroglyphs, Arts and architecture, Society and culture, Religion and philosophy, Native Americans.

Portrait of Frances C. Houston; Thomas Wilmer Dewing painted his vivacious friend in a seventeenth-century costume in the spirit of Frans Hals or Diego Velázquez, two of their favorite old masters. He wrote to the editor of Century Magazine, praising Houston's "sense of style." Dewing and Frances had studied in Paris, where both artists would have made head studies like this one. After she returned to the United States, Frances married William C. Houston, the proprietor of a Boston department store. The couple purchased property near the Dewings' summer home in Cornish, New Hampshire, where they joined in the social activities of a vibrant art colony. Houston worked in Cornish as a portrait painter and jeweler, but was also known for her impressive cooking and gardening. (Hobbs, Beauty Reconfigured: The Art of Thomas Wilmer Dewing, 1996);  .

Model house, Chogoria, Kenya, ca.1924; “The model native house, built on piles with wicker & mud floors, kitchen separate.” Exterior view of a house on piles with a couple standing outside. Dr Irvine designed a model house that he thought would improve the health of the local population. Traditional huts had a cooking fire and no ventilation and doorways were sealed with piled logs that were difficult to get out of if there was a fire. Dr Irvine’s design removed the kitchen to a separate hut, raised the hut on piles, added windows and doors and strengthened the structure. The huts were made completely from local material and generated a lot of interest. ❧ This image is from the first years of the Chogoria mission in Kenya, which was run by the Rev. Dr Archibald Clive Irvine (1893-1974), from the collection entitled ‘Chogoria, 1922. The early days.”; Construction (assembling), Dwellings, Home.

Freshman Camp (1930); This photograph shows six students at the 1930 Springfield College Freshman Camp. They are performing a variety of activities, such as chopping wood, raking, and cooking. Edgar Munroe Robinson largely organized and implemented the Freshman Camp. Robinson brought many of the boys’ work and physical education ideas from the YMCA and Boy Scouts of America to Springfield College and its Freshman Camp. He also assisted in building the two camp lodges: Pukwana Lodge and the Pueblo of the Seven Fires. The Freshman Camp tradition continues today with the College’s Outdoor Pursuits program for incoming students. Robinson was a graduate of Springfield College, class of 1901. After working with both the YMCA and the Boy Scouts of America, Robinson returned to his alma mater in 1927 as a faculty member. Robinson was granted an honorary Master of Humanics degree from the College in 1928.;  .

Plate from NOLA; Emeril appeared with Julia Child on her program Cooking with Master Chefs, and the episode, which featured a crab and crawfish boil, was a hit. Producers thought Emeril’s culinary talents and ease in front of the camera would make him an ideal host on the Television Food Network, which launched in 1993. His first show, How to Boil Water, was designed for viewers new to cooking. During the show Emeril read from a script, following the existing format of educational public television programs. The show was unsuccessful, and in response the Food Network re-imagined the type of programming it would broadcast, placing Emeril at the center of this transformation. New programming, like Emeril Live, relied on the host’s personality to win over audiences. With a signature slogan of, “Bam!,” a studio audience full of fans and a live band, Emeril Live represented the beginning of a new era of food television, and a model for future Food Network programs.;  .

[Letter to] My Dear Anna [manuscript]; Angelina Emily Grimké thanks Anne Warren Weston for information about Mrs. Maria Weston Chapman's health. She doubts if Mrs. Chapman will suffer any loss of mental powers. She discusses the "Woman Question" and the New England convention. She is interested in knowing the details of Abby Kelley's part in the convention. Grimké asks: "Has unity of spirit been restored to the Female Society in Boston?" She describes moving into her new house before it was ready. Since she has no servants, she does all her own work. She feels "that we should show we are not ruined as domestic characters" as part of the effort to further the cause of women's rights. Grimké admits that she still has a lot to learn about cooking and housekeeping. She will not hinder Sarah M. Grimké's return to Massachusetts;  .

M. F. K. Fisher; Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher wrote elegant books and essays about the history, sociology, and pleasures of food. From the joys of a tangerine section toasted on a radiator and then cooled on a snowy windowsill to the taste of her first raw oyster, Fisher, with her sensuous prose, won the respect of many literary figures, including W. H. Auden and John Updike, who called her "a poet of the appetites." She spent much of her life in California, where she wrote such classics as Consider the Oyster (1941) and How to Cook a Wolf (1942), which gave advice on cooking with wartime rations. Late in life, while living in Glen Ellen, California, she sat for Ginny Stanford, who captured a strong woman looking into an unknown future "illuminated by a single silver icon.;  .

To its left, women are observable in what appears to be a cooking area under a tent; one is peeling what seems to be a potato and others are using a cloth to dry dining utensils.; To the right of the center, a group of men are visible on a table holding cards. Behind them, a tent is seen with a small sign that reads: "JIM and SUSIE'S POOR-HOUSE". A man and children are viewable in the far right, under a tree, holding either a book or some kind of magazine. A banner can be seen in the right which reads: "Puff and Blow Inn."

He published 18 books and numerous pamphlets, including biographies of Thomas Birch Freeman and William Carey. He travelled to the mission fields extensively, visiting the West Indies in 1930. The earliest Wesleyan mission began in the West Indies when, in 1786, Thomas Coke, destined for Nova Scotia, was driven off course by a storm and landed at Antigua in the British West Indies. There he dieveloped a successful mission of both slaves and landowners. Within a few years almost every colony in the West Indies had been reached.; Walker, Frank Deaville, 1878-1945, Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society, Group portraits, Children, Fashion.

Tappan Model RL-1 Microwave Oven; Raytheon’s first microwave oven, the Radarange, was bought by a Cleveland restaurant in 1947 for $3,000. The 1955 model produced for home use failed to sell well due to its steep price as well as customer confusion about how to use the appliance. By 1976, a brand-new microwave oven cost less than $300 and people bought them for offices, dorm rooms and break rooms. The microwave has become more than a tool for re-heating—it is a large part of lifestyles that do not always accommodate lengthy cooking times or complex food preparation.;  .

Spinning as we see it in a Telemarken Home, Norway; [transcript: 13497; Spinning as Seen in a Telemarken Home, Norway. Spinding i ett Hjem, Telemarken, Norge. Spinning i ett hem, Telemarken, Norge. This is a typical scene of home industry among the peasants of Telemarken, as well as elsewhere in Norway. Formerly all that was needed for the clothing of a household was prepared by the women. Then both men and women were dressed in homespun. In later times, however, this custom has gradually given way to the importation of factory goods. Yet many a housewife, at the old farmstead, is still busy with adding to the wardrobe of the family. In this view we see a basketful of white wool which has been washed and carded. Then there is the old-fashioned spinning wheel which has such an interesting place in romantic literature. On this the good housewife spins the daintiest thread of the soft fleece, while, perhaps, she is humming a lay to the noise of the wheel. Sometimes more than one wheel may be in use, and the presence of another in our picture suggests a busy spinning time in this characteristic room. Look at its primitive fireplace! This is probably open so one may see the sky through it. This was in olden time the hearth where large logs were burning day and night, during tfie cold winter season, and from which the house received its heat and cheer. Here also the cooking was done in large kettles, and a long iron-hook on one side of the fireplace indicates that it still may be used for this purpose. The cooking stove tells us, however, that modern improvements have been introduced.

Animal products, genetic susceptibility and cancer risk; Epidemiological evidence points towards the role of diets high in red and processed meats in the cancers of many tissue types. The mechanisms by which meat consumption may lead to cancer risk are not well understood. Meat is a complex exposure, i.e. a mixture of various potential carcinogens that may individually or collectively contribute to cancer risk. In these studies we investigated whether carcinogens that accumulate during the process of high temperature cooking of meats, or to due to cooking of meats to high levels of doneness, might increase the risk of prostate and colorectal cancer risk. These carcinogens include heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Moreover, diets high in processed meats may contribute to exposure to N-nitroso compounds (NOCs), which can also be formed endogenously when diets are high in red meat intake. To better understand which of these carcinogens might be more likely to explain the observed association between meat and cancer we considered variation in genes that metabolize HCAs, PAHs or N-nitroso compounds (NOCs), and genes that repair DNA damage caused by these exposures, to test for gene-exposure interactions. Given that some of these genes play specific roles in the metabolism of each type of carcinogen, finding of an interaction would help us identify which substrate is more likely to play a role in meat-induced carcinogenesis. Diets high in meat, as well as dairy, are also a rich source of phytanic acid. This branched-fatty acid has also been postulated to play a role in cancer. Therefore, we also investigated whether variants in AMACR, an enzyme that plays a key role in the metabolism of phytanic acid ,may associate with prostate cancer risk. ❧ We tested our hypotheses for prostate cancer using the resources of the California Collaborative Case Control Study of Prostate Cancer that included food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) data for 1,096 controls, 717 localized and 1,140 advanced cases. We conducted analyses for colorectal cancer risk in participants of the Colorectal Family Registry (CFR), an international consortium of six centers from the United States, Canada and Australia.We had food frequency questionnaire data for 3,364 probands, 1,942 familial controls (siblings/ spouse) and 1,620 population based controls. ❧ In the prostate cancer study, pan-fried red meat and white fish were associated with a statistically significant increased risk of advanced prostate cancer. Since pan-frying is associated with the formation of HCAs, but not PAHs or NOCs, we speculate that dietary HCAs may be relevant risk factors of advanced prostate cancer. However estimated levels of total dietary heterocyclic amines using the CHARRED database were not associated with risk of prostate cancer. We observed evidence of modification of the effect of 'estimated mutagenic activity' on advanced prostate cancer risk by a promoter polymorphism in PTGS2, an enzyme that plays a role in activation of both PAHs and HCAs in the prostate as well as in inflammation. We did not find any evidence in support of the hypothesis that phytanic acid may mediate associations between meat products and prostate cancer risk. ❧ In the colorectal study, we did not observe any associations for well done meat types, oven broiled or grilled meat types with colorectal cancer risk. However, of the 6 meat types for which we had pan-frying information, three (beef, spam and sausage) showed a statistically significant increased risk of colorectal cancer. As with the prostate cancer study, estimated levels of heterocyclic amines were not associated with the risk of colorectal cancer. The findings of our studies point towards at least a partial role for meat cooking related exposures and risk of cancers, and have potential implications both in understanding the mechanisms of meat related carcinogenesis and in the public health goal of cancer prevention.;  . 
Ninth General Hospital. World War II. Goodenough, New Guinea; Unmounted prints showing nurses cooking at the military hospital camp at Goodenough, New Guinea.; The Secretary of War contacted George Heuer regarding resurrecting the Ninth General Hospital in October 1940. The unit was not deployed to active duty until July 15, 1942. The doctors and administrated officials from the Ninth General Hospital trained at Fort Andrews, MA Base and the Nurses at Fort Devins, MA Base. The men at Fort Andrews trained orderlies, nurses aides, and technicians. The nurses worked at the New Station Hospital at Fort Devins until deployed overseas. July 18, 1943 they were all finally shipped overseas to Brisbane, Australia. The doctors went on to Goodenough, New Guinea while the nurses initially stay behind at Brisbane. At Goodenough the doctors suffered through a typhus epidemic and a monsoon. In August 1944, the hospital moved. The nurses were dropped off in Hollandria, New Guinea and the men went on to Biak Island. In August 1945, they moved the hospital to Luzon, Philippines briefly. After the war ended the unit went to Manila, Philippines where the hospital was disbanded and most of the staff sent home or sent to other military hospitals. The name of the Ninth General Hospital was given to a regular unit in Okinawa, Japan. Doctors and Nurses from both the New York Hospital and the Cornell University Medical College served in the Ninth General Hospital during World War II.; Buildings, military camps, Groups, nurses, Buildings, military hospitals, Cornell University Medical College, New York Hospital, World War II, Ninth General Hospital.

Missionaries camping at Laroki river, Papua New Guinea, ca. 1890; Our Wet Camp at the Laroki River. Kitchen, H[arry].M[oore].D[auncey], F. Lawes, Mrs. Lawes, C. Lawes". Group at rest under tent. Indigenous men and boys cooking in background.; One of 113 albumen prints mounted in an album by W.G. Lawes. Formerly the first resident missionary on the South Sea island of Niue, Lawes transferred to Papua New Guinea in 1874 until his retirement in 1906. Lawes was a pioneer missionary photographer, and the first permanent non-indigenous resident of Papua New Guinea. He created the first photographic images of the islands and its peoples as well as images of missionary work, which were distributed commercially through Henry King of Sydney. Lawes' knowledge of, and role in, Papuan life was also of paramount importance to other photographers, particularly those of colonial government and expeditionary parties, such as the Australia-based professional photographer J. W. Lindt, who acknowledged the decisive role that Lawes played in facilitating his visit to Papua New Guinea and the photographic work he was able to carry out.; London Missionary Society, Lawes, William George 1839-1907, Dauncey, Harry Moore, 1863-1932, Group portraits, Clergy. 
Alice B. Toklas; Young artists like Pavel Tchelitchew were immediately drawn to Stein but warmed more slowly to Alice, who was less visible and forthcoming. But many came to appreciate Alice’s quick tongue, sense of humor, and housekeeping skills, especially her needlework and cooking. They wrote and spoke of their lingering memories of the two women at leisure, Toklas bent over her sewing and Stein over a book. Here, Toklas, with her conspicuously overstated bangs and flowery blue dress, bends over her handiwork.;  . 
Whisk, ca 1950; Although whisks varied in sizes, from tiny to giant, people loved the gigantic balloon whisks Julia had used on television, almost like props, to dramatic and comic effect. Julia loved giant tools, the more outrageous the better. Audience remembered the lessons when Julia deployed her giant whisks, blowtorches, salad spinners, and they learned that some of these tools were actually useful. Still, they especially remembered Julia AND her whisk when next they went to the kitchen store, creating a whole new market for these useful tools. This whisk, a part of Julia’s batterie de cuisine, had served her well in her home kitchen and television kitchen, in some cases the very same space.;  . 
Velasquez Riley Family History, Part 1; Part 1: Barry Richens interviewed Mary Velasquez Riley at the home of Mrs. Minnie Guenther February 18, 1977. Mrs. Riley gives us insight into the Apache culture as she tells her life story. Her father, Jesus Velasquez, was of Spanish descent and her mother was Apache. He was an interpreter and scout for Fort Apache. When he was but a boy, his family had moved to Arizona with the soldiers from Fort Davis, TX. On the way, his father had been killed by Chiricahua Apaches, but his mother continued on, making a living washing and cooking for the soldiers. They settled in the Fort Apache area and he grew up there among the Apaches. He married Mary's mother in 1899-1900, after his first wife, a Carrizo Apache, had died. Mary was born in 1908 at Fort Apache. Jesus Velasquez was a hard worker. He had a large ranch where they supplied the Fort with milk, beef, sheep, goats, chickens, turkeys, etc. Since he was often gone, Mary remembers working hard before and after school to keep the ranch going and the milk deliveries on time. When the Spanish Influenza Epidemic hit in 1919, Mary's father pulled her out of school to help care for sick relatives and she never returned. She explains to Mr. Richens the Apache custom of girls "coming out.; Oral histories, Arizona History, Apache County (Ariz.), Navajo County (Ariz.), Biography, Scouts and Scouting--Arizona--Biography, Velasquez Family, Military Camps--Arizona, White Mountain Apache Tribe of Arizona, White Mountain Indian Reservation (Ariz.), Fort Apache Indian School (Whiteriver, Ariz.), Agriculture, Family and community, Land and resources, Military and war, Native Americans, Race and ethnicity, Society and culture. 
Hart, William Henry vol 1; Handwritten diaries with typescripts in four volumes. Volume 1 concerns Hart's overland journey by ox team from Quincy, Illinois, to the Humboldt Valley, Nevada, in 1852. Hart is an insightful and descriptive diarist. He writes about cooking and commerce on the plains, encounters with Indians, and dissatisfaction in his company. Hart mentions a handful of deaths from cholera and includes a moving description of one funeral. He also gives a festive account of his company's celebration of the Fourth of July, and describes an anniversary dinner at Salt Lake City which his companions attended. A substantial description of Salt Lake City is included. Volume 2 concludes Hart's journey to California. Hart mined for gold and worked as a shingle maker, and writes extensively about his four years in California. He left San Francisco in December 1856 and steamed to San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua. There his steamer was hijacked by Costa Rican forces in an effort to defeat William Walker, an American attempting to capture Nicaragua. Hart spent several months visiting family after his return to New York. Hart also writes about his life in Illinois and contemporary events. The repository has volumes 1, 2, 3, and 5.

MacDonald's Clam Shell Container; In 1940, Richard (Dick) and Maurice (Mac) McDonald opened the first McDonald’s Bar-B-Q drive-in restaurant in San Bernardino, California. In 1948, the brothers redesigned their menu, centering on the 15 cent hamburger. In 1954, Ray Kroc, a Multimixer (milkshake machine) salesman, became interested in the McDonalds brothers’ high volume restaurant. He worked out a deal with the brothers to be their franchising agent and opened the first franchise location in Illinois the following year. Under Kroc’s direction, the company grew to become the giant we know today.;  .

Townhouses View from Stagg Field; This photograph displays the back of Springfield College's Townhouses, with a view taken from Stagg Field. In the center of the Townhouses is the Conference Center. The Townhouses were constructed in 1989 as senior apartment-style living and are still in use today. The building is located parallel to the Stagg football field and measures approximately 350 feet in length by 35 feet in width. The building has the capacity to house 160 students in total. The Townhouses consist of 20 units, and each unit is a separate residence with three floors, housing eight students. The 20 units are divided into two separate wings, each wing with 10 units. In the middle of the two wings is a conference center, a lounge, housing for the Residence Director, as well as the laundry room in the basement. The first floor of each Townhouse consists of a living room and kitchen and the second and third floors each have four rooms and one bathroom. All together this totals eight single bedrooms and two baths. All essential furniture, appliances, and utilities (heat and air conditioning) are included and laundry is shared by all tenants. All of the houses have access to a backyard, where students can enjoy cooking, socializing, or even watching a sporting event.;  . 
Untitled; Post-war strikes had turned public opinion against organized labor by early 1947. Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act over President Harry S Truman's veto. The act outlawed industry-wide strikes, mass picketing and the closed shop; made unions liable for law suits; established cooling-off periods before strikes; prohibited the use of union funds for political contributions; and gave the President broad power to obtain injunctions in cases of strikes which involved interstate commerce, communications and public utilities. President Truman had recently announced a plan developed by the American Federation of Labor and construction contractors to arbitrate pay and other disputes with the aim of avoiding strikes. Cartoonist Clifford Berryman shows a pleased Truman taking a bite of the new building trades agreement cake while commenting to the cooks creating the new labor legislation that he hoped the new cooking would taste as good as the agreement cake. The three cooks are Senators Robert A. Taft, Jr. of Ohio, Joseph H. Ball of Minnesota and Smith.;  .

Camp life in Holota, Ethiopia, 1928; Adolf Müller between two tents at a campfire holding a cooking pot. To the left Hermann Grabe mending a saddle, Herrmann Bahlburg is holding a gun.; cf. picture no. ELM/AE/Fotos - 68.--The picture was taken on the first mission caravan to Aira.--Hermann Bahlburg (1892-1962) was the leader of the Galla [Oromo] mission of the Hermannsburg mission in Ethiopia from 1927 until his internment in 1941. He was based mostly in Addis Abeba, where he promoted the founding of a German school and church. He was part of the first caravan to Aira and undertook several journeys to the newly established mission stations in Aira and Bedele. From 1941 to 1948 he was interned by the British occupying forces. Afterwards he returned to Germany, where he continued his work as missionary until he was banned by the leadership of the Hermannsburger Missionsanstalt. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 2007.--Hermann Grabe (1901-1984) was a ship carpenter and deacon. He was a missionary of the Hermannsburg mission in Ethiopia from 1927 to 1935.--Adolf Müller (1905-1936) was a mission artisan of the Hermannsburg mission. He started his work as a missionary in Ethiopia in 1927. From 1928 he served in Aira, later in Bedele. He was married to Minna, née Nottorf. In may 1936 he left Bedele with his wife and baby to flee to Addis Abeba. He was killed on the way in an attack on the caravan.; General views, Food preparation, Handicrafts, Leisure. 
Urban food production;; M.Arch; From the Proposal: ”When eating or preparing a meal, how often do we think about the source of our ingredients? We know it came from a grocery store or food supplier, but where and how was it grown, and by whom? Urban Food Production will provide students with the knowledge to not only become well-rounded chefs and/or restaurateurs, but also inform them of the benefits of growing their own ingredients. Students will learn the rituals that go with planting and harvesting specific crops throughout the seasons. And with these crops, students will then understand the source and benefits of using fresh ingredients. Although a cooking school with numerous gardens is more conducive to a rural setting, Urban Food Production will be located in downtown Salt Lake on 650 South State Street. Salt Lake does not have a dedicated and accredited culinary institute. With the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, numerous ski resorts that welcome guests from all over the world, and food culture becoming more popular, Salt Lake is in need of new chefs. The institute will serve as a source for those needs, and in turn, it will educate the public on growing and using organic ingredients.”;  .

Mr Wylie's house, Manchuria, 1889; “Chinese house at side of principal house (Cook at door)”. Exterior view of manse at Liaoyang showing the domestic and cooking quarters which are built in a more traditional style to the main house. An indigenous man poses at the door. ❧ The image is from an album associated with Rev. James A Whylie (1863-1894) who was ordained to the Manchuria mission in 1887 and based in Liaoyang, 1888-1894. He did much itinerant work and built upon the work of Old Wang who had been the ‘native evangelist’ in Liaoyang until his death in 1885. When the first Sino Japanese War (1894-1895) broke out troops were being gathered to send to Korea and suspicion of foreigners was heightened. In Liaoyang, on the 10 August 1894, a group of Chinese soldiers wrecked the U.P. chapel and attacked Mr Whylie, who died of his wounds several days later. Missionaries and foreigners then sought refuge in the port of Newchwang where many remained until the war ended the following year.; Buildings (structures), Dwellings, Houses, Manses.

Creamer from the Yellow Luncheon Service for Six; Beatrice Wood was best known for elaborate forms and shiny, iridescent glazes, known as lusters. She also created utilitarian pieces like this creamer. Wood exaggerated the creamer’s spout and handle, lending a hint of whimsy to the functional piece. The bright yellow glaze is most likely unique to this particular luncheon service. She often compared creating glazes to cooking—she took a basic formula and made slight adjustments each time, resulting in unique glazes that could not be replicated. Wood had a great sense of humor and joked later in life that she was the only person who could afford to eat off of her plates ("Luster for Life" [Beatrice Wood at Ninety-Seven], House & Garden 162, no. 6 [June 1990]).;  .

Hart, William Henry vol 2; Handwritten diaries with typescripts in four volumes. Volume 1 concerns Hart's overland journey by ox team from Quincy, Illinois, to the Humboldt Valley, Nevada, in 1852. Hart is an insightful and descriptive diarist. He writes about cooking and commerce on the plains, encounters with Indians, and dissatisfaction in his company. Hart mentions a handful of deaths from cholera and includes a moving description of one funeral. He also gives a festive account of his company's celebration of the Fourth of July, and describes an anniversary dinner at Salt Lake City which his companions attended. A substantial description of Salt Lake City is included. Volume 2 concludes Hart's journey to California. Hart mined for gold and worked as a shingle maker, and writes extensively about his four years in California. He left San Francisco in December 1856 and steamed to San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua. There his steamer was hijacked by Costa Rican forces in an effort to defeat William Walker, an American attempting to capture Nicaragua. Hart spent several months visiting family after his return to New York. Hart also writes about his life in Illinois and contemporary events. The repository has volumes 1, 2, 3, and 5. Volume 4 is missing.;  .

The entertainment value in food and its value to the public relations industry; Over the past several decades, food entertainment has had a significant influence upon shaping and redefining American culinary culture. Whether it is through its programs or associated figures (i.e., celebrity chef or host), food entertainment has made its way into mainstream media and become the "go-to" source of entertainment and food-related information for many consumers.; As food entertainment continues to flourish not only in the United States, but also throughout the world, public relations professionals must pay attention.; This study will peel away the layers of food entertainment to discover its true impact on culinary culture. It will first explore the evolving consumer and the modern definition of cooking. It will then go into the rise of food entertainment through a tribute to Julia Child and in depth look at the Food Network, both pioneers in the food entertainment industry.; Finally, this paper will provide a thorough analysis of food entertainment outcomes followed by a list of recommendations for public relations professionals for using food entertainment as a resource in a strategic communication campaign.;  .

Visualizing culinary culture at the Medici and Farnese courts; Gastronomy has traditionally been viewed as a product of early modern court life, but I argue for a more nuanced relationship in which the representations of culinary culture in print or painting ensured its cultural centrality. The producers and consumers of culinary imagery performed complementary roles that assured the importance of a sophisticated and theatrical cuisine for sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Italian courts. Preparing, presenting, and consuming elaborate meals were not only deeply ritualized activities but also created and affirmed political, diplomatic, and personal hierarchies and allegiances. Early modern Italy experienced a surge in professionalized culinary activity as cooks, stewards, carvers, and other domestic officials refined their craft, published their work in books such as Bartolomeo Scappi’s "Opera" (Rome, 1570) and Mattia Giegher’s "Li tre trattati" (Padua, 1639), and fashioned a market for their expertise in the courtly milieu. My studies of the “period appetite” at the seventeenth-century Medici and Farnese courts demonstrate how culinary practices in Florence and Parma were informed and shaped by the collecting of kitchen equipment, culinary treatises, and idealized paintings of edible goods by Giovanna Garzoni and Felice Boselli. By putting illustrated books and archival material in conversation with watercolor and oil still life paintings housed in rural villas, this dissertation argues for the necessity of crossing disciplinary boundaries to understand the histories of art, collecting, and food. The producers of these textual and visual records—cooks, stewards, and artists—performed the culinary culture of their elite patrons through detailed cooking treatises, lavish manuscripts, and series of bountiful still life paintings. In so doing, they actively shaped an idealized food culture specific to their courtly and regional environs.; Early modern alimentary practices—including the processes of understanding, selecting, organizing, butchering, cooking, and presenting foods—shared ideological links with contemporary medicine, alchemy, and botany as they mediated between nature and man. This historicized study of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century culinary culture demonstrates that illustrated books and paintings of edible goods should be understood as constructed fictions offering reassuring visions of a hierarchical, lavish, and orderly gastronomic culture to their patrons in Florence and Parma. The elevation of food and dining was essential to the structure and functions of the Medici and Farnese courts and the recording of these gastronomic practices in print and painting played a key role in constructing and enacting ducal dominance over politics, culture, and nature.;  .

Tree habit; The Juglans nigra (black walnut) is usually 100-150 feet tall. The wood of this tree is usually hard, strong, and heavy, and a rich dark brown color with a satiny texture. It is native to the Midwest and east central United states. Black walnut had commercial value even for early colonists in North America, where it was cultivated. In 1610 in Virginia, William Strachey stated that it was being shipped back to England as a valued commodity, but the colonists also seemed to value it as well. Black walnut was used in interior decorating and cabinet-making because of its fine color and texture. It was also used for gunstocks and coffins, as well as in boat and ship building. The walnuts were also edible and used in cooking or eaten raw, both by colonists and also by Native Americans who lived in the Mississippi Basin. The trees were first introduced into Europe in the mid-17th century by John Tradescant (1608-1662) and first described by John Parkinson (1567-1650) in Theatrum Botanicum.;  .

Jewish Heritage Collection: Oral history interview with Helen Laufer Berle; Helen Berle, a daughter of Harry and Tillie Hufeizen Laufer, immigrants from Mogelnitsa, Poland, reminisces about her parents’ business, Laufer’s Kosher Restaurant on King Street in Charleston, South Carolina. Popular among local merchants and military servicemen stationed in Charleston and Beaufort, the eatery served Jews and non-Jews for about two decades beginning in the early 1930s. Berle describes some of the kosher-style dishes that Jews from the Old Country brought with them to America. “Everything was just good, plain, old, basic cooking. . . . I think seasoning had a lot to do with it.” While blacks could not eat at Laufer’s, they were hired to work in the kitchen, and she recalls that the relationship between members of the Jewish and black communities of Charleston were good in the years before the Civil Rights Movement.

Hart, William Henry vol 2; Handwritten diaries with typescripts in four volumes. Volume 1 concerns Hart's overland journey by ox team from Quincy, Illinois, to the Humboldt Valley, Nevada, in 1852. Hart is an insightful and descriptive diarist. He writes about cooking and commerce on the plains, encounters with Indians, and dissatisfaction in his company. Hart mentions a handful of deaths from cholera and includes a moving description of one funeral. He also gives a festive account of his company's celebration of the Fourth of July, and describes an anniversary dinner at Salt Lake City which his companions attended. A substantial description of Salt Lake City is included. Volume 2 concludes Hart's journey to California. Hart mined for gold and worked as a shingle maker, and writes extensively about his four years in California. He left San Francisco in December 1856 and steamed to San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua. There his steamer was hijacked by Costa Rican forces in an effort to defeat William Walker, an American attempting to capture Nicaragua. Hart spent several months visiting family after his return to New York. Hart also writes about his life in Illinois and contemporary events. The repository has volumes 1, 2, 3, and 5. Volume 4 is missing.;  .

Serviceman's Wife; In Serviceman’s Wife, Ivan Olinsky painted a woman looking up expectantly, perhaps to greet her husband, who has just opened the door. Her skirt draws out the yellow of the pears in the background and her full lips match the apple’s rosy skin. The grays and blues of her shirt echo those of the white cloth on which the fruits rest. She is integrated into her environment as if she is simply one part of a still life. Olinsky specialized in idealized images of women, and his portraits were successful on the market, selling for up to $2,000 each in the 1920s. His work had grown even more popular by the 1940s, when he worked for the commercial firm Portraits, Inc. Critics noted that each of his women looked like “a hardy perennial despite her delicate air.” (Cummings, Olinsky, Faces of Change: The Art of Ivan G. Olinsky, 1878-1962, 1995);  .

Whirligig with Woman Churning and Man Sawing; Farmers created whirligigs to entertain their children and decorate their gardens. These colorful, animated devices also added an element of fun to an otherwise demanding life in rural America. This piece shows the everyday activities of churning butter and sawing wood. When the wind blows, the lady’s arms move up and down and the man’s saw moves back and forth. The large painted arrow on the back of the whirligig suggests it was also used as a weather vane.;  . 
Comanche Village, Women Dressing Robes and Drying Meat; “The village of the Camanchees,” George Catlin wrote, “is composed of six or eight hundred skin-covered lodges, made of poles and buffalo skins, in the manner precisely as those of the Sioux and other Missouri tribes . . . This village with its thousands of wild inmates, with horses and dogs, and wild sports and domestic occupations, presents a most curious scene; and the manners and looks of the people, a rich subject for the brush and the pen . . . In the view I have made of it, but a small portion of the village is shewn; which is as well as to shew the whole of it, inasmuch as the wigwams, as well as the customs, are the same in every part of it. In the foreground is seen the wigwam of the chief; and in various parts, crotches and poles, on which the women are drying meat, and ‘graining’ buffalo robes.” The artist sketched this image at a Comanche village in 1834.

The Speculator; A rural couple listens skeptically to a representative of the Building Association, identified by the paper in his coat pocket. The salesman—whose top hat, pointed shoes, and umbrella mark him as a city slicker—promises the couple a better life as he unrolls a listing of "1000 Valuable Lots on Rail Road Ave." Francis William Edmonds's comic genre scenes captured the rough-and-tumble of America's frontiers. Democracy meant opportunity for all, and there were plenty of opportunities to fleece the unwary in settlements governed by few laws. Land speculators flourished as the railroads raced West and small towns dreamed of growing into great cities.Exhibition Label, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2006;  .

Board of Regents Report 1913-1914 Page 67; REPORT OF UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA 67 Valley near Deeth, Wells, Tobar, Metropolis, Clover Valley, and Ruby Valley south of Wells, Ely, East Ely, McGill, Northam, and Reno. The subjects discussed at the various meetings were as follows: II Extension Plans. Power of Diet and Good Cooking, or the Factors Involved in Planning a Meal. Principles of Cooking Different Classes of Food. House Plans and Home Decoration. ' Girls' Home Economics Clubs have been organized in twenty-six communities. The total membership of these clubs up to the present date is 318 girls between the ages of 10 and 20 years. The girls' clubs have received the first lesson which is on soup making. These lessons are prepared by the Department of Home Economics and in most cases are demonstrated and carefully explained before the work of the clubs is started. When the lesson is completed each member is furnished with a list of questions to be answered and returned to the University to be carefully examined and graded by the Home Economies Department. Five ladies' Home Economics Clubs have been organized in Lee, Starr Valley, Wells, Metropolis, and Ruby Valley. One thousand two hundred and fourteen ladies and girls have been told of the extension work. The largest attendance at any meeting held has been 65, and the average attendance 28. All who have been told of the extension work have shown a great deal of interest and enthusiasm, besides a readiness to cooperate with the University of Nevada in establishing this work in the rural districts. Specialists from various departments in the College of Agriculture have given several demonstrations to the farmers of the State. The Department of Agronomy has confined the extension work to the relation of soils and irrigation, to crop production, the importance of selected seed for maximum yields of farm crops, methods of conserving soil moisture for dry-farming areas, and the marketing of farm products. Nine meetings were held in different rural districts with a total attendance of over nine hundred. The Department of Animal Husbandry has given demonstrations on the selection of steers, and cows for the feed lot, the selection of breeding animals both for beef and various animal products, the testing of dairy animals, and the value of cow-testing associations. By request, P. W. Wilson, in charge of the Department of Animal Husbandry, has visited six districts and talked to over eight hundred and fifty farmers and their boys. Dr. W. B. Mack, in charge of the Departments of Bacteriology and Veterinary Science, has visited Wells, in Elko County, and Winnemucca, in Humboldt County. At these two meetings he has explained in detail to over one hundred and twenty-five livestock men the extension work which has been planned for the treatment of the important diseases among the various breeds of live stock. George G. Schweis, of the Department of Entomology, has carried on demonstration work on the methods of combating insects injurious to field and orchard crops, diseases of bees, the management of an apiary, and the modern methods of marketing the products of the Dairy. The demonstration work on farm-crop pests was conducted in Truckee, Mason, and Lahontan Valleys. Three apiaries in Smith;  .

Townhouse Backyards; This photograph displays the backyards of the Springfield College Townhouses. The Townhouses were constructed in 1989 as senior apartment-style living and are still in use today. The building is located parallel to the Stagg football field and measures approximately 350 feet in length by 35 feet in width. The building has the capacity to house 160 students in total. The Townhouses consist of 20 units, and each unit is a separate residence with three floors, housing eight students. The 20 units are divided into two separate wings, each wing with 10 units. In the middle of the two wings is a conference center, a lounge, housing for the Residence Director, as well as the laundry room in the basement. The first floor of each Townhouse consists of a living room and kitchen and the second and third floors each have four rooms and one bathroom. All together this totals eight single bedrooms and two baths. All essential furniture, appliances, and utilities (heat and air conditioning) are included and laundry is shared by all tenants. All of the houses have access to a backyard, where students can enjoy cooking, socializing, or even watching a sporting event. The Wellness Center, now a part of the new Wellness Center/Physical Education Complex, was located in the basement of the townhouses. It was a 47,840-square-foot fitness area with weights and workout rooms. It opened in September 2008 and was moved by 2010. This basement space, as of 2013, is currently used to house the Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) department.;  .

OXO Good Grips Pie Server; Introduced in 1990, the first Good Grips implements featured contoured rubber handles with flexible “fins” modeled after the grips on bicycle handlebars. These handles were featured in the original line of fifteen products including a vegetable peeler, can opener, and an orange zester. OXO products follow the Universal Design philosophy in which designers take into consideration the greatest variety of needs in order to create products that are usable by as many people as possible. Even the OXO name was chosen with these design principles in mind because it reads the same horizontally, vertically, upside down, or backwards. OXO ads emphasized the comfort and ease of the handles, telling customers to “Hold the tools the way you want to hold them, not some way you’re forced to hold them.”;  .

William Harbach Oral History Interview; The first part of the tape is devoted to a discussion of the social interactions of Mercer and Harbach during the 1940s and 1950s. Harbach talks of a few social occasions at which Mercer and Harbach were both present. He mentions particularly Mercer's love of cooking. Harbach then reminisces about his working relationship with Mercer, especially Mercer's guest appearances on the Tonight show in the 1950s and his performances with Bing Crosby on The Bing Crosby Show in 1960. In the course of the conversation, Harbach relates some humorous and touching anecdotes that reveal Mercer's character and personality. The discussion then turns to a New Year's trip to see Mercer in Savannah that Harbach and other friends took sometime during the late 1950s. Harbach talks at some length of Mercer's final illness and death, and he speaks of Mercer's memorial service in New York, which Harbach himself produced. At the end of the conversation, several topics are touched upon briefly, including the Mercers' social life in New York and Hollywood, writing Broadway musicals, Mercer's character, and the personality of Mercer's wife Ginger.;  .

CorningWare® Casserole Dish; This casserole dish was donated to the museum by Mrs. Anne L. Bernat, who received a set of CorningWare® dishes as a wedding present in 1967. At the time of the donation, in 2011, she still used her dishes to heat, serve, and store casseroles and other foods. Over the years she developed a system for using them efficiently: when making casseroles for future use, she first lined the CorningWare® dishes with plastic wrap, poured in the raw mixture, and placed the dishes in the freezer. Once the mixtures were frozen, she popped the wrapped, un-cooked casseroles out of the dishes and left them in the freezer, freeing up the dishes to be used again and not wasting freezer space. Whenever she wanted to serve a casserole, she unwrapped one of the frozen squares and placed it back into the same-sized CorningWare® dish for heating. Mrs. Bernat also took her casseroles on the road: for visits to family members, she packed the frozen, pre-made casserole squares into coolers and delivered them to her children and grandchildren.;  .

Watertown Square; Looking down Galen Street the large building near the center is the Walker and Pratt Manufacturing Company. Miles Pratt built a foundry in 1855. A long brick warehouse was flush with the sidewalk on Galen street, the moulding room was flush on Main Street and there were wharves in the Charles River. The factory covered about two acres. As Miles Pratt struggled with his business, he associated himself with Luke Perkins of the grist mill as his superintendant and Oliver Shaw was his manager. It became Pratt and Perkins in 1857. In 1862, the company reformed again and became Miles Pratt and Co. All three came from Carver. MA. Pratt consolidated with W. Walker & Co. The new partner was Arthur Walker of Malden. In 1877, the Company incorporated and became Walker, Pratt & Company. In 1861 the Company went to manufacturing ammunition and gun-carriage castings. They worked with Gen. Thomas Jackson Rodman, Commander of the Watertown Arsenal. In 1880 a fire-proof building was constructed, 264 feet long, sixty feet wide and three stories high on Galen Street. The pattern storeroom on the island, with a solid wall towards Galen Street--that is a wall without windows, although ornamented with piers and arches, - shows on the south side by its tiers of windows, four stories above a solid foundation wall. There is a furnace capable of melting fifteen tons of iron at a blast. The moulding room is 14,000 square feet. Walker and Pratt built homes between the stockyards and Hood Rubber Company for their employees. They built a new brick factory. They found markets all cross the U.S. and Southern Africa for their Pratt furnaces and Crawford stoves. Heating apparatus were made for the Hotel Vendome, Boston and Madison Square Theater in New York City. They also made hot water and steam heater, ranges and steam and hotel cooking apparatus, tin roofing and copper, tin and sheet-iron work. Walker and Pratt endured a strike by the employees for a salary of $2.50 a day. The building at the right is Lewandos.;  .

OXO Good Grips Potato Masher; Introduced in 1990, the first Good Grips implements featured contoured rubber handles with flexible “fins” modeled after the grips on bicycle handlebars. These handles were featured in the original line of fifteen products including a vegetable peeler, can opener, and an orange zester. OXO products follow the Universal Design philosophy in which designers take into consideration the greatest variety of needs in order to create products that are usable by as many people as possible. Even the OXO name was chosen with these design principles in mind because it reads the same horizontally, vertically, upside down, or backwards. OXO ads emphasized the comfort and ease of the handles, telling customers to “Hold the tools the way you want to hold them, not some way you’re forced to hold them.”;  .

Grass Fed Beef New Product Old Friend; JULY 1976 L 41 New Product Old Friend Marjorie Stevenson COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SERVICE MAX C.

I~weased feed costs, acres of grazing land, uncer-tainty about world food problems, and soaring beef prices may mean changes in traditional methods of raising and marketing Nevada beef. Costs, weights, grades and feasibility of raising more grass-fed beef can be measured. Less easily measured is consumer acceptance of a different type of beef from what fam-ilies are accustomed to. Ultimately the consumer will decide whether to purchase grass- or range-fed beef. Cuts from the chuck, round, rump, arm and blade can be roasted (to medium doneness) or braised. Moist heat cooking like braising or stewing will pro-duce the most tender meat. For families who like well done meat, it might be wiser to buy these cuts and cook in moisture. Again, because they have less marbling, a marinade may be desirable to increase tenderness. ~ i b sra ted highest HOWEVER, the grass-fed rounh roast rated higher than its counterpart. Consumers are concerned about the cost of beef. Given a choice between less or more tender beef, they would buy less tender beef if the price difference is at least 23# per pound.

Elko Selected Elko, Nevada, was chosen for testing consumer ac-ceptance of grass-fed vs grain-fed beef. Ranching is a major industry in that county and cattle used were raised at Knoll Creek Field Laboratory as part of Agriculture Research Project 330, "Forage Finishing of Beef." The State Nutrition Specialist, Elko County Live-stock Agent and several Cowbelles set up sampling tables in a supermarket. Shoppers tasted and scored four pieces of meat--two grain-fed and two grass-fed samples. How Do You Cook Grass-Fed Beef? Depending upon the age of the animal when mar-keted, grass-fed beef can be as tender as grain-fed beef. The meat will have less fat, especially if mar-keted very young. This may affect cooking methods. l[s Grass-Fed Beef Nutritious? All beef is a good source of complete protein, B vi-tamins, iron, zinc and many other trace minerals. Since grass-fed beef has less fat than grain-fed beef, it can be of extra importance in many special diets. Less fat means an equal sized serving of grass-fed beef will contain fewer calories for those on weight reduc-tion diets. For those on low saturated fat diets, less fat means less cholesterol than the same cut of grain-fed beef. Many consumers don't know that even with all visible fat cut off, a piece of grain-fed beef still con-tains as many calories of fat as proteh. The Elko supermarket experience told us that Ne- , vada consumers WILL buy grass-fed beef. Some liked the slightly chewy texture better than the grain-fed samples. When asked which of four samples they liked best and least, shoppers voted as shown in the charts below. NOTE that they chose grass-fed rounds over grain-fed. Re tail Pricing Whether consumers will benefit by markedly lower prices is unknown at this time. More smaller animals will be processed for the same quantity of meat in-creasing labor costs while lowering feeding costs. Consumer acceptance and volume of grass-fed cattle may make the difference. Always compare prices for the best buy in your area for family meals.

McDonald's Double Clam Shell Container; In 1940, Richard (Dick) and Maurice (Mac) McDonald opened the first McDonald’s Bar-B-Q drive-in restaurant in San Bernardino, California. In 1948, the brothers redesigned their menu, centering on the 15 cent hamburger. In 1954, Ray Kroc, a Multimixer (milkshake machine) salesman, became interested in the McDonalds brothers’ high volume restaurant. He worked out a deal with the brother to be their franchising agent and opened the first franchise location in Illinois the following year. Under Kroc’s direction, the company grew to become the giant we know today.;  . 
Spinning flax with a spinning wheel-beginning of the great linen industry, Ireland; [transcript: POSITION:-Outside a cottage door in a village in County Mohaghan, northeastern Ireland. Outlook: This old woman has known how to spin ever since her own mother taught her when she was a little girl. The linen wheel itself is even-older than its user an inheritance from another generation (when Quantities of flax were grown about fiere and spmning|| was one of the chief cottage industries. At present life soil of the flax fields in this locality is exhausted, and all the profitable spinning is done elsewhere. The old woman is not actually at work at this moment, but is only showing us how the wheel was formerly used. The coarse flax, hatcheled (combed) into smooth, parallel fibres, used to be wound on a rod (the distaff), fastened to that farther, upright post. The smaller post, this side of the distaff and at the left, held the spindle, a slender rod, kept whirling rapidly bv having transferred to it the motion of the wheel. You can see from here how cords lying in grooves around the rim of the wheel are connected with the spindle shaft, as the machinery of a sewing machine is connected with the wheel by a band. This wheel was kept in motion by working the treadle with the foot. When actually spinning, a woman would keep the wheel going rapidly and at the same time pull gently a small quantity of the flax fibres from the distaff, to the spindle; there the rapid whirling of the spindle twisted the fibres into one continuous, strong thread. The spinner of course had to watch carefully to see that the flax was fed out regularly from the distaff, avoiding breaks and lumps. As fast as the fibres were twisted into thread they were wound on bobbins. Just such shawls and aprons and caps are worn by tidy, self-respecting old women all through this part of Ireland. The cottage is of stone, plastered and whitewashed, with a thatched roof. The cooking is done over coals of peat in an open fireplace.

View of Townhouses through Fence; This photograph depicts the Springfield College Townhouses taken from a view through the fence surrounding Stagg Field and the Townhouse backyards. There is a leaf stuck in the fence. The Townhouses were constructed in 1989 as senior apartment-style living and are still in use today. The building is located parallel to the Stagg football field and measures approximately 350 feet in length by 35 feet in width. The building has the capacity to house 160 students in total. The Townhouses consist of 20 units, and each unit is a separate residence with three floors, housing eight students. The 20 units are divided into two separate wings, each wing with 10 units. In the middle of the two wings is a conference center, a lounge, housing for the Residence Director, as well as the laundry room in the basement. The first floor of each Townhouse consists of a living room and kitchen and the second and third floors each have four rooms and one bathroom. All together this totals eight single bedrooms and two baths. All essential furniture, appliances, and utilities (heat and air conditioning) are included and laundry is shared by all tenants. All of the houses have access to a backyard, where students can enjoy cooking, socializing, or even watching a sporting event. The Wellness Center, now a part of the new Wellness Center/Physical Education Complex, was located in the basement of the townhouses. It was a 47,840-square-foot fitness area with weights and workout rooms. It opened in September 2008 and was moved by 2010. This basement space, as of 2013, is currently used to house the Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) department.;  . 
Japanese in Utah; C-239, No. 81, Box 5; This is a picture of the smelter camp in Midvale, Utah (a smelting town some 12 miles southwest of Salt Lake City) where we moved in the early 1920's after the boom wore off in Tooele. My father was again a camp "boss" and worked for the United States Smelting and Refining Co. for nearly 30 years. He lost his job when the war broke out and he was interned. He went back to the smelter for a short time and worked until his death in 1948. This camp as I recall was not an all-Japanese as the Tooele Camp had been; in fact, there were only a handful of Isseis (four including my father when WWII started) living here and there quite a number of Greek single men as well as a Mexican family--quite cosmopolitan. However since my father spoke English fluently, he was in charge of the camp--collected the rent for the smelter ($1.50 monthly with electricity free and it was turned on at dusk and off at dawn. There was no central heating and the large frame house with the three chimneys where we lived was the only house with culinary water. The others had to get their water for bathing and cooking from the waterhouse. We got our house free as part of the services rendered by my father for the smelter. We occupied only the lower floor. Our house was frame and Dad had the smelter construct a Japanese "ofuro" for the Japanese residents and it was a real luxury for us. He even had a shower installed so that we could wash first before getting into the huge wooden tub. It was part of our chores to keep the furnace going so that there would be plenty of hot water when the men returned from work. The rest of the smelter residents lived in the barrack-type building (made of brick) and the Mexican family got three rooms with a door connecting the rooms. I recall they had 7 or 8 children.; Ethnic groups--Utah, Japanese--Utah, Smelters.

Perry Family History, Part 2; Part 2: Even though Edgar Perry was McNary High School's Best Player when he graduated in 1959, he was denied a scholarship because he chose Grand Canyon College in Phoenix, a private Christian school. While attending college, he and his wife Corrine taught Sunday School at the nearby Indian school and sang in cantatas. They missed the coolness of Mt. Baldy in the Valley's heat, and so when invited to become missionaries while attending the Clear Creek Bible College in Pineville, Kentucky, they accepted. The Perry family was warmly received, and grew and thrived in Kentucky. They traveled, visiting various churches singing Apache songs, teaching via chalk talks, street preaching, visiting rest homes and prisons. He recalled the wonderful generosity of the poor people, of eating from bountiful pot lucks of Southern cooking and living on a wage of $15 a week. He also remembers fondly the "crazy preachers," and his adventures with them exploring caves, of night fishing, and of tossing horse shoes and playing basketball. After graduating, the Perrys moved to Plainview, TX where Edgar attended graduate school at Wayland Baptist University, working on a Master's Degree in Sociology and Art. During the school year he worked as the janitor of a large church, but in the summers they traveled between McNary, Arizona, and Kentucky ministering. When funds ran out, Edgar could no longer complete his education, and so they returned home to the White Mountain Apache Indian Reservation.; Oral histories, Arizona History, Apache County (Ariz.), Navajo County (Ariz.), McNary (Ariz.), White Mountain Apache of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, Arizona, White Mountain Apache Indians--Biography, White Mountain Apache Indians--Arizona, White Mountain Apache Culture Center, White Mountain Apache language, Apache Indians--Social life and customs, Perry, Edgar, Arts and architecture, Education, Land and resources, Native Americans, Race and ethnicity, Religion and philosophy, Society and culture, Work and labor.

Townhouse Construction; This picture displays the construction of the second half of the Springfield College Townhouses. The Townhouses were constructed in 1989 as senior apartment-style living and are still in use today. The building is located parallel to the Stagg football field and measures approximately 350 feet in length by 35 feet in width. The building has the capacity to house 160 students in total. The Townhouses consist of 20 units, and each unit is a separate residence with three floors, housing eight students. The 20 units are divided into two separate wings, each wing with 10 units. In the middle of the two wings is a conference center, a lounge, housing for the Residence Director, as well as the laundry room in the basement. The first floor of each Townhouse consists of a living room and kitchen and the second and third floors each have four rooms and one bathroom. All together this totals eight single bedrooms and two baths. All essential furniture, appliances, and utilities (heat and air conditioning) are included and laundry is shared by all tenants. All of the houses have access to a backyard, where students can enjoy cooking, socializing, or even watching a sporting event. The Wellness Center, now a part of the new Wellness Center/Physical Education Complex, was located in the basement of the townhouses. It was a 47,840-square-foot fitness area with weights and workout rooms. It opened in September 2008 and was moved by 2010. This basement space, as of 2013, is currently used to house the Visual and Performing Arts (VAPA) department.;  . 
French Chef: Asparagus From Tip to Butt; The show opens with Child glowing over how much she appreciates asparagus and giving viewers advice about how to judge, purchase, and store it. Child emphasizes the importance of preparing asparagus the French way—cutting off only a small amount of the bottom and especially peeling the stalk--asserting that it results in using more of the asparagus, makes it easier to cook and eat, and results in fresher-tasting finished asparagus. She instructs viewers in how to peel the asparagus (using a French vegetable peeler), then tie it into bundles and cook it in boiling water. Although she is clear that it can be served simply with only some lemon juice and salt to flavor it, she prepares a sauce maltese, which consists of hollandaise sauce with orange flavoring. She demonstrates how to beat eggs yolks, juice and other ingredients over heat until they become a custard, then adds melted butter orange flavoring. She describes serving and preparation for asparagus that is to be served cold as well as warm. Finally, she demonstrates how it can be served and eaten. Throughout the episode, and especially in the final scenes, Child stresses the exceptional taste of asparagus, the benefits of cooking it as the French do, and her intense enjoyment of it. She points out that people might eat asparagus every day when it is in season, so having a sauce helps to vary it. She also encourages viewers to serve it on its own as a first course or as a substitute for a salad course. Finally, she concludes by leaning back and lowering a whole stalk into her mouth. Summary and select metadata for this record was submitted by Tracey Deutsch.;  . 
Miles Pratt (1825 - 1882); Co-founder of the Walker and Pratt Foundry and member of the Town committee that raised money to begin the library. Miles Pratt built a foundry in 1855. A long brick warehouse was flush with the sidewalk on Galen street, the moulding room was flush on Main Street and there were wharves in the Charles River. The factory covered about two acres. As Miles Pratt struggled with his business, he associated himself with Luke Perkins of the grist mill as his superintendant and Oliver Shaw was his manager. It became Pratt and Perkins in 1857. In 1862, the company reformed again and became Miles Pratt and Co. All three came from Carver. MA. Pratt consolidated with W. Walker & Co. The new partner was Arthur Walker of Malden. In 1877, the Company incorporated and became Walker, Pratt & Company. In 1861 the Company went to manufacturing ammunition and gun-carriage castings. They worked with Colonel Thomas Jackson Rodman, Commander of the Watertown Arsenal. In 1880 a fire-proof building was constructed, 264 feet long, sixty feet wide and three stories high on Galen Street. The pattern storeroom on the island, with a solid wall towards Galen Street--that is a wall without windows, although ornamented with piers and arches, - shows on the south side by its tiers of windows, four stories above a solid foundation wall. There is a furnace capable of melting fifteen tons of iron at a blast. The moulding room is 14,000 square feet.

Hoeing Rice, South Carolina; [transcript: 105--(13751); HOEING RICE, SOUTH CAROLINA; Lat. 33 N.; Long. 80 W.; Here you have a view of rice cultivation in the old way. The ground is first plowed and a good seed-bed is made. Then the grain is drilled and the field is flooded until after the seeds sprout. Then the water is let off the fields, allowing the ground to dry. Again the field is flooded and the water is removed so that the plants may be cultivated. That is what the negroes are doing in this field. Instead of using machines, as is done generally in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, these people are hoeing the weeds out. The weeds grow very rapidly, almost as rapidly as the rice. It is a serious problem for the rice farmer to keep the weeds from choking the young rice plants out. Three and sometimes four floodings are given the rice fields before the grain is full-grown. Before harvesting, all the water is drained off, allowing the soil to become dry and firm. Rice binders, machines that look like wheat binders, are used to harvest it. The grain is tied in bundles, set in shocks, and later threshed. The threshing machine leaves a hull over the grain, so that the threshed grains look like threshed oats. Before the grains can be used for cooking purposes, it is necessary to mill them. That is, they are run between millstones and the outer hulls removed. The grains are then run through a polisher so that the rough ends are removed. This is the reason that the rice which you buy has its shiny appearance. The countries of southeastern Asia lead all others in the production of rice. China, Japan, Indo-China, India, and the neighboring islands grow millions of bushels every year. The chief food of the people of most of these countries is rice. The total yield in the United States in 1915 was- about 402,041 tons. British India alone in 1915 produced 56,706,248 tons.

Ellsworth Family History, Part 2; Part 2: Pete remembers starting out as newly-weds, their first home together near Mormon Lake, adjusting to his bride's cooking, and Betty Jo's first horse riding experiences. They had three sons, buy lost their middle one at age 7 to a malignant brain tumor. Wes and Flynn still live close by. Pete lost some fingers working at Mormon Lake, so they came back to Show Low and he went to work at Bourdon Ranch. Their youngest son, Flynn was born there. Next, Pete worked in town at a cement block plant and insulation company for Harv Ellsworth, but the work took him away from home a lot. So when the opportunity arose for a job working for Arlie Maxwell at the Arizona Highway Department, he took it. They were working on the road between Show Low and Heber, so the Ellsworth family relocated to Aripine so Pete could run a blade. He gives a brief description and history of Aripine. When Flynn became school age, the Ellsworths moved back to Show Low and Pete ran the snow blade up on the mountain on the Big Lake road. He recalls the Big Snow of '67, of Army bombers dropping bales of hay to stranded cattle, and of rescuing cattle by plowing roads to feed them, and a humorous story about soothing a cranky cow. Pete then tells the story of the time he roped a big buck deer just to do it, and then once roped, the time he had trying to get loose from it.; Show Low (Ariz.)--History, Cowboys--Arizona--Humor, Arizona Dept. of Transportation Highways Division, Snow--Arizona, Agriculture, Business and industry, Family and community, Land and resources, Society and culture, Work and labor.

Specimen of an annual sunflower, [s.d.]; Photograph of a specimen of an annual sunflower, [s.d.]. Three flowers are visible on the branch. On a neutral background.; "These are hardy herbaceous perennials or annuals found wild in North America. They produce large yellow flowers in late summer and autumn. The perennial kinds are tall and vigorous. H. decapetalus multiflorus and its double variety, Soliel d'Or, grow 4 to 5 feet high. The prettiest one is called Monarch; it is a variety of H. atrorubens sparsifolius. This plant will grow 6 to 7 feet high and bear large, golden yellow blooms. All of the perennial kinds have yellow blossoms. H. argyrophyllus, the Silverleaf Sunflower is an annual kind that grows about 6 feet high. Its leaves are clothed with silky, soft hairs, which give them a distinctly silvery appearance. It produces many yellow flowers, 3 inches in diameter that have dark brown-purple centers. H. annuus is an annual commonly known as the Sunflower. It grows 6 to 10 feet high and produces huge, black centered flowers. There are varieties of the Sunflower with different colored flowers. Some are reddish, pale or deep yellow. The largest is the variety Russian Giant."--unknown author (part 1 of 2).; "The seeds of the Sunflower are rich in oil; the best kinds contain 28 or 30 percent. When cold pressed, this oil is useful as a salad oil, for cooking and for the manufacture of margarine. The seeds are also used for bird food for poultry and parrots and other caged birds. H. tuberosus, also known as the Sunchoke, Jerusalem Artichoke, or Girasole, is a hardy perennial grown for its edible tubers. As you can see, the Jersalem Artichoke is a relative of the Sunflower, not the Globe Artichoke (see, Cynara). This is a vigorous, enduring, versatile plant, which will grow up to 6 feet high in sunny, dry locations and much taller in fertile soil and partial shade. It produces yellow flowers with dark centers that are filled with small seeds, which birds love. They spread quickly and can become a nuisance. The Jerusalem artichoke is usually grown in the far corner of the garden because they aren't very pretty looking. The texture of the tubers is much like early potatoes, but they have a slightly sweeter taste. They can be eaten raw or cooked like potatoes. The tubers contain insulin, a carbohydrate that diabetics can digest."--unknown author (part 2 of 2).; Botany--Flowers, Flowers.

Some are actiA'e in P. T. A., Girl Scout and Civil Defense and Vitamin Research Avork. The First Aid and Wild Life Service of the Sheldon National Ante¬ lope Refuge at Cedarville, California, asked us to do some experimental work on the cooking of antelope meat. Beginning in December, we have received two antelopes a month. This Avork is to continue for a year. It is interesting work and we trust it will be of value to the Government. The latter part of April, the Department held their annual Fashion Show and Tea. This is given as a demonstration of the Avork done by students during the year. FACULTY At the beginning of this biennium. Miss Doris Nesbit resigned as teacher trainer, ancl Mrs. Gwendolyn AVagner was chosen a,s her succes¬ sor. Miss Sarah Lewis retires this year as head of the School of Home Economics. She will be replaced by Miss Mildred SAA'ift. STUDENT ACTIVITIES The Sarah L. Lewis Home Economics Club is composed of the Faculty and Home Economics students. The purpose of the club is to develop friendship, cooperation and leadership among its members. The club opened the fall semester Avith a tea honoring the incoming Freshmen. Other social activities Avere a party for the Aggie students, Christmas party. Senior banquet, and a picnic to close the year. At the regular luncheon meetings the speakers Avere Mrs. Adden- brooke, Avho told of her trip to Porto Rico; Miss Jessie Pope reported on the National Home Economics meeting at Chicago, and her trip through the East. Mrs. Eunice Griffith, Infirmary Matron at UniA'ersity of NeA'ada Hospital, spoke on Red Cross work. Miss Gladys Wycoff, the National Secretary of Clubwork of Ameri¬ can Home Economics Association, AA'as the last guest speaker. The club participated in the activities of Homecoming Day, Engi¬ neers' Day and prepared and served the Mackay Day Luncheon as usual. RECOMMENDATIONS The College is seriously handicapped by the fact that we do not operate a University farm for experimental, instructional and demon¬ strative purposes for use by the students in the College of Agriculture. It is strongly recommended that the farm owned by the University and which was formerly operated as a livestock farm be again operated as an experimental and instructional farm for use by the students in the college. It is again recommended that the University ask the next Legislature for a definite appropriation for this purpose. The college also needs a modern well-equipped farm shop for instruc¬ tional work for those students who expect to teach vocational agricul¬ ture in the high schools and for those who expect to go back to the;  .

Un factor importante en la disminución de la cobertura forestal lo constituye la poca eficiencia en el uso del potencial calorifico de la leña por los dispositivos utilizados para cocinar los alimentos de las familias, en las comunidades rurales, los que desperdician según algunos autores hasta un noventa por ciento del calor del combustible. Existe en la actualidad varias alternativas para promover la redución del uso de leña siendo la introducción de estufas mejorada una de ellas, sin embargo deben de ser evaluadas para determinar la eficiencia de las mismas. Con el presente trabajo de Investigación Inferencial se determinó y analizó la eficiencia en tiempo y en volumen de leña consumido por las Estufas Mejoradas de tipo Finlandia y Josefina en comparación con el sistema de fogón abierto utilizado por la mayor parte de la comunidad de Salitrón, del municipio de San Juan Ermita, Chiquimula.;  .

Z_029_Diet Kitchen; On December 31, 1910, fifteen patients were transferred to the Dee Memorial Hospital accompanied by five graduate nurses and three student nurses. These women formed the first faculty and student body of the Dee School of Nursing. The student nurses lived in the basement of the Hospital and classes were held there. Nurses were required to register in and out of quarters and could not remain out after 10 p.m., with the privilege extended to a midnight curfew once a month. Night duty was handled by students with one in charge of each nursing floor. Nurses were also expected to do special private duty nursing in the Hospital and in homes for practical training without additional compensation.The Dee School of Nursing operated with few changes until World War II when a section of the U.S. Cadet Nurses Corps was organized to help with the shortage of nurses. The scholarships paid the tuition and issued a small stipend. The only requirement was that the students remain active in nursing during the war. The last class graduated in 1955 when the school merged into the nursing program at Weber College. In its forty-five years of existence, the school graduated more than 700 nurses, many of whom continued working in Northern Utah.With the last graduating class in 1955, the alumni are disappearing fast and we wanted to capture their stories before they were lost like the Dee Hospital. Through this oral history project, we learned about the women behind the grades and photographs. They talked about their experiences with the doctors, patients, and each other. They expressed the hard work they put in on a daily basis but also the fun times such as sliding down the hills during the winter on the steel bed pans. This oral history project put faces and stories to the static student records and expanded on what became of them after they graduated from the Dee School of Nursing.;  .

COOKOUTS FOR THE GANG 4-H Outdoor Cookery - Unit I1 by June C. Gibbs Extension Nutritionist University of Arizona Nevada families can eat out-of-doors 6 to 8 months of the year, depending on the part of the state in which they live. Everybody's going to want to eat when you plan meals out-of-doors. To some, a picnic means a lunch prepared at home, packed into a basket or box and carried along to the favorite picnic spot. Others of us prefer a cook-out which means simply cooking out-of-doors. This may be done on a grill in your own back yard, at a fireplace alongeide a highway, or over a campfire in the mountains or on the desert close to nature, Outdoor eating can mean the thrill of preparing and eating hearty meals. Half the fun of eating outdoors comes in th$ cooking of interesting foods. Preparing and eating food in the open air brings a feeling of freedom and relaxation for everyone so they make the little extra work and planning worth-while, \ A cook-out is a form of recreation and entertaining which can be not only tops in good eating, but also gives us a chance to display our skills in planning, cooking and camping. When the aroma of broiling meata i e blended with the lingering fragrance of camp smoke, and mixed with crisp Preeh aiz, the appeal of eating out-of-doora makes hearty appetites and the food tastes better than ever. You'll get a real kick out of being able to produce a delicious outdoor meal, one thatte fun and eaey to fix, Plan to entertain your family and friends with a cook-out more often. Good Planning is Important - 2- Remember, the wise outdoor cook plans meals that meet the basic needs of successful cook-outs. These basic needs are: 1. Simple in content. 2. Well organized. 3. Interesting food. 4. Well balanced menus. 5, Nutritious foods. 6, Safety practiced a t the cook-out . 7. A11 people take part i n the work, 8. Foods carefully prepared. 9. Hot foods served hot and cold foods served cold. 10. Leave a clean campground, NUTRITION We like to think we are w e l l fed in America. And we are, compared to many coun-tries, Although good food ie available i n large quantities, many of us need to im-prove out diet. The foods most commonly lacking in our d i e t s are the ones that furnish us Vitamins A and C and the mineral calcium. This mane we need mars green and yellow vegetables, citrus f r u i t s , tomatoee or cantaloupe and dairy foods. We must remember to get an adequate amount of all the nutrients and we must carefully plan our meals. Meals b prepared on cook-outs can be juet as nutritious as meals prepared at home.

Use s p l i t logs rather than round smooth ones. soft woods such as pine, spruce, cedar, aspen burn quickly but cool rapidly, leaving very few glowing coals. Hardwoods such as oak, mequite and ironwood burn slowly, m hey provide excellent coals for brofling, baking and toasting. Here is the way to s t a r t your f i r e with wood: Start a small f i r e with a crumpled piece of paper. Build a teepee around it with fine dry twigs, bark strips or shavings. Leave enough space between the twigs to let a i r through to the fire; As the f i r e burns, add dry s t i c k s which are a little larger. Keep adding larger s t i c k s u n t i l the f i r e is burning hot, then add large sticke or small logs and allow them to burn into a good bed of red coals. It w i l l take from 1 1/2 to 2 hours for a wood f i r e to burn down to a good bed of hot coals. Charcoal Charcoal G r i l l Charcoal fires give coals that are hot for a considerable length of time. Hardwood charcoals produce a minimum of sputter, smoke and smell and they burn 1 hot for a longer period of time than those made from soft woods. Buy a bag marked lthardwoodlr rather than one labeled "mixed woods" or "picnic charcoal1'. Lumps and briquettes are satisfac-tory. Select lump charcoal which i s uniform in size or briquettes of good quality, not those pressed from miscel-laneous scraps and sawdust. Lump char-coal usually costs slightly more than briquettes. Three to four pounds of briquettes or about 15 or 20, are suffi-cient to cook steaks and coffee for six people. For roasts or chickens on the s p i t it w i l l take 50 or more depending on the size of the roast or chicken, Start a charcoal f i r e a t least half an hour before you want to use it. Pile the charcoal into a pyramid in the fire-place. Build the bed only slightly larger than the area to be covered by the. food and about 1 1/2 inches deep, (More heat can be produced i f you make a thin bad of sand for the charcoal. The sand w i l l provide some ventilation and intensify the heat .) Pour a small amount of charcoal lighting fluid (odorless) onto the charcoal and) let it soak into the coals for about 3 to 4 minutes. Ignite the coals and allow them to burn for a while. Do not add more lighting fluid. The f i r e from charcoal i s al-most invisible at f i r s t . Start to cook the food when a l l the coals are 2/3 covered with a gray ash. Spread the coals out evenly with a poker or stick and tap them lightly to knock off the ash, void cooking while there are flames. I f the f i r e needs replenishing as the cooking progresses, add more charcoal to the edge of the f i r e about 15 minutes before you want to use it. After the new char-) coal has ignited, feed it i n t o . the f i r e as needed. Safety F i r s t For Fires Leave the cookout site clean and a t t r a c t i v e whether i t is your own backyard or i n a public park. Put out the f i r e completely with d i r t that is free of leaves or sticks. You can use water to put out a f i r e i n an improvised fireplace. DO NOT pour water into a hot brazier or charcoal burner as it may damage the metal; instead, empty the l i v e coals into a metal container and smother them with d i r t or water from the sprinkler bottle. A large t i n can with holes in the bottom is fine for t h i s . TYPES OF OUTDOOR COOKING Toasting - "To brown Toasting Stick by heat ,I1 best done over good coals, Patience i n L-waiting for the f i r e t o burn t o coals is its own reward! A good campcrafter t o a s t s h i s bread or marshmallows GOLDEN BROWN, evenly done on a l l sides. I When a flaming f i r e . must be used, hold the food to one side of the flames in-stead of I N or OVER them or the food w i l l be smoked in-stead of toasted. Broiling - "To cook by direct exposure to heat." Broiling is a method ueed in cooking meat, especially tender cuts l i k e chops or steak, I f l e s s tender ateak such as round is used, a tenderizer should be used before broiling. It is usually done on a g r i l l , green s t i c k , or on a wire skewer. Broilfng is best done over coals. The food should be turned often and cooked slowly, Ae i n toasting, flame8 w i l l smoke the food. Always turn steaks with a tong or a spatula - never prick it with a Pork. Pan-Broiling - is done i n a pan. Heat the pan f i r s t , put i n meat, turn S k i l l e t for Frying often, pouring off f a t as it accumu-l a t e s , keeping as dry as possible so meat does not fry in f a t . Stewing or Boiling - Less tender cuts of meat are good for etew. They have more flavor but take longer to cook. For stews, m e a t should be browned quickly i n f a t and simmered i n water un-til tender. Generally speaking, the longer and slower the cooking, the bet-ter the stew. For boiling, have a cover on the pot t o hasten the process. Put the k e t t l e on the f i r e as soon as it is burning w e l l . Frying - "To brown or sear in fat in a T ~ E "i s best done over a bed of coal s , since flames are l i k e l y to l i c k i n t o the Fan end the grease catch on f i r e . Gener-ally, a am11 amount of f a t is all that is necessary for frying. Draining fried f'cod on a po,Fer napkin or towel helps to get r i d of excess grease. When frying bacon, onions, etc., for a one-pot rceal, fry in the bottcrn of the kettle t o Ee used and pour off the grease when the food is brown, adding other i n - gredients as needed. Meal on a Rock On-a-Rock cocking is another kind of frying i u which a flet stone io thoroughly cleaned, heated and theo used as a frying F ~ L . -E arbeculng - is Bn interesting and popular methcd of preparing fcod out-of .-doors. The barbecuinTof meat on a spit over gl-owing coals was a part of festive occasions in tines ~aS't. Lc recect years, hcwever, i.t has 'become an irngurta.nt paxt of everyday out-d o ~ rcc r>kery. It may be done i n the backyard, a% a. picnic, or at a cam~eivlgs -ite. The bus'ic principle of the barbecue is t o rotate the food which has been covered wit11 barbecue scuce over a bed of c ~ a l su n t i l it i s done. The food is placed on a spit or g r i l l , brushed with barbecue sauce, and either turlied frequently or ratated s l ~ w l yu n t i l done. Additlens of a a u c e are brushed on a t each turning or f'req~ie~t1.y during the rctcztion of the food. E-ak-in g - there are any ways of baking out -of -door s .

Bill Bowick and David Bouffard, Interview by Shannon Hungerford, 18 April 2009; “Sugar” is a bakery located on Cannon Street in downtown Charleston, S.C. that was founded by Bouffard and Bowick in November of 2007. Bowick, a native Tennessean, and Bouffard, a native of Vermont, have replaced an old vegetable stand with a new sweet shop. Both men worked in New York as architects, but moved to Charleston twelve years ago to pursue their dream of baking. In this interview, Bowick and Bouffard discuss their career backgrounds and inspirations, and how their background in architecture relates to the process of baking. They also discuss family connections to Charleston and local cuisine, the relationship between history and Charleston history in recipes, and how customers are attracted to the historical side of certain treats. An openly gay couple, Bowick and Bouffard also comment on the warm welcome they received upon moving into the neighborhood and what it says about how Charleston has changed in the last decade.; Bakery employees--United States, Cooking--American--Southern Style.

Industry--Watertown, Mass; Site of Union Market Bank. Corner of Main and Galen Streets. Large building at left was Walker Pratt Mfg. Co. Notice all the telephone poles. Union Market Bank was founded in 1873 founded by Charles J. Barry (who would later resign and found the Watertown Savings Bank), Royal Gilkey (owner of the Royal Gilkey Wood and Coal Company), George K. Snow, George N. March, Thomas L. French and James S. Allison. The Bank supported the small business man and local building projects. Rarely was stock sold and it was a community bank. Miles Pratt built a foundry in 1855. A long brick warehouse was flush with the sidewalk on Galen street, the molding room was flush on Main Street and there were wharves in the Charles River. The factory covered about two acres. As Miles Pratt struggled with his business, he associated himself with Luke Perkins of the grist mill as his superintendant and Oliver Shaw was his manager. It became Pratt and Perkins in 1857. In 1862, the company reformed again and became Miles Pratt and Co. All three came from Carver. MA. Pratt consolidated with W. Walker & Co. The new partner was Arthur Walker of Malden. In 1877, the Company incorporated and became Walker, Pratt & Company. In 1861 the Company went to manufacturing ammunition and gun-carriage castings. They worked with Gen. Thomas Jackson Rodman, Commander of the Watertown Arsenal. In 1880 a fire-proof building was constructed, 264 feet long, sixty feet wide and three stories high on Galen Street. The pattern storeroom on the island, with a solid wall towards Galen Street--that is a wall without windows, although ornamented with piers and arches, - shows on the south side by its tiers of windows, four stories above a solid foundation wall. There is a furnace capable of melting fifteen tons of iron at a blast. The moulding room is 14,000 square feet. Walker and Pratt built homes between the stockyards and Hood Rubber Company for their employees. They built a new brick factory. They found markets all cross the U.S. and Southern Africa for their Pratt furnaces and Crawford stoves. Heating apparatus were made for the Hotel Vendome, Boston and Madison Square Theater in New York City. They also made hot water and steam heater, ranges and steam and hotel cooking apparatus, tin roofing and copper, tin and sheet-iron work. Walker and Pratt endured a strike by the employees for a salary of $2.50 a day.;  . 
Close-up of a specimen of English walnut (Juglans regia), ca.1920; Photograph of a close-up of a specimen of English walnut (Juglans regia), ca.1920. On light background.; "These deciduous trees are found wild from southeast Europe to the Himalayas, through China to Manchuria and Japan, and in North and South America. Most of them are hardy. Various species of Juglans are commonly known as Walnut trees. These trees are grown for their beauty, some for their timber and some for their edible nuts. The leaves, sap and husks will definitely stain anything with which it comes in contact. Walnuts are monoecious, that is, male and female flowers are produced on the same tree. The male flowers are produced in long catkins and the inconspicuous, greenish female flowers are borne in clusters. Male and female flowers are not open at the same time, so in order to pollinate, two or three trees should be planted near each other. J. regia, the English or Persian Walnut grows from 80 to 100 feet high and produces nuts popularly called English Walnuts. There are many varieties that vary in hardiness, nut size, and thickness of the nutshell."--unknown author (part 1 of 2).; "The English Walnut may be grown over a large portion of the U.S., but nut production is confined mainly to California and parts of Washington and Oregon. J. nigra, the Black Walnut, is hardier than the English Walnut and is grown for ornament, its timber, and its nuts. The leaves are from 1 to 2 feet long, alternate, pinnately compound, with 13 to 23 ovate-lance-shaped leaflets which are attached to a stout, downy rachis. The leaflets are from 2 to 4 inches long and yellowish-green with a paler and often fuzzy underside. The walnuts are round and 1½ to 2 inches in diameter with a sculptured bony shell. They are surrounded by a slightly fleshy, greenish husk during the summer, at that time, the nut is 2 to 3 inches in diameter. They ripen in October and drop from the trees. The Black Walnut grows from 50 to 75 feet high. The Black Walnut is also valued for its wood, which is a rich, dark brown color. It is heavy, strong, hard and very durable when in contact with the soil. It is used in making furniture and gunstocks. The nuts are rather oily with a strong, unique flavor. They are widely used in cooking. The hulls that surround the nuts were used as a dye by the early pioneers."--unknown author (part 2 of 2).; Agriculture--Crops--Walnuts, Walnut, Orchards. 
Group of Los Angeles YMCA youngsters open the 1954 summer camping season, 1954; 2 images. Group of L.A. YMCA youngsters open the 1954 summer camping season. Group of 140 Boys from 9-12 leave for Camp Round Meadows in the Barton Flats area of the San Bernardino Mountains. (Handout); Supplementary material reads: "From: YMCA of Los Angeles, Trinity 4751, Ralph Broms. Date: 1954-06-22. Fact Sheet: First group of Los Angeles YMCA youngsters open the 1954 summer camping season. This Group: This group of 140 boys, 9 to 12 years old, is the first to leave from Los Angeles YMCA branches. They will go to Camp Round Meadow in the Barton Flats area of San Bernardino mountains. They will be accompanied by 19 volunteer cabin counselors and four YMCA staff members. Camp director will be Edgar A. Drake, executive secretary, West Los Angeles YMCA branch. Total YMCA Camping Program: This West Los Angeles group is the first of 79 groups from 23 community 'Y' branches which will attend five Los Angeles YMCA camps in the San Bernardino and High Sierra mountains this summer. It is expected that a total of more than 6000 youths, 9 to 18, will be in the program. They will be accompanied by more than 600 volunteer cabin counselors in addition to YMCA secretaries....; Supplementary material continutes: Other San Bernardino Camps: Other camps in the San Bernardino area, Little Green Valley, Big Pines and Mozumdar, will open later this week. Programs include swimming, hiking, handicraft, athletics, horseback riding, and daily chapel services and campfire programs. With the exception of Mozumdar, the long term camp near Crestline, these San Bernardino area sites hold eight-day periods. Age range: 13 to 18. High Sierra Programs: The High Sierra Base Camp, in the Mammoth Lakes area, will open next Monday. Programs operated out of this site include the back country pack-in trip and the Caravan trip through the high Sierras and Yosemite. Both are eight days and both stress the more rugged type of camping--boys sleep on the ground and do their own cooking. Age range: 13 to 18. Operation of YMCA Camps: All camps are operated by the Camp branch of the Los Angeles YMCA for the community branches. Groups attend from the branches, and programs are planned and directed by branch YMCA secretaries".;  .

Letter dated 10 October 1967 from Mathias and Margaret Richards to Lorenzo and Zilla Richards; The Case of the Tense Lobsters Condensed from "HOME IS WHERE YOU HANG YOURSELF" CYNTHIA LINDSAY "In Brazil," said a gourmet friend of ours, "there's a way of cooking chicken that's the end. You take a live chicken and give it some r u m —" "Rum?" I cried. "The chicken?" "Absolutely," said the friend. "You see, the theory is sound. For in­stance, you wouldn't want your head chopped off, would you? You'd get all tense, wouldn't you?" "You bet," I answered. "So does the chicken," he said, warming to the subject. "So they give the bird some rum. Pretty soon he passes out. Then off with his head, and into the pot—every mus­cle relaxed. Tender, that is." The following week I was having guests for dinner, and I had ordered live Maine lobster. They arrived, packed in huge buckets of seaweed. I dragged the buckets into the kitchen and dumped the lobsters out. They skittered around on the floor, bugging their eyes and snap­ping their claws. Then they backed up against the sink and glared at m e tensely. Tense! I2B "H ° M E 'S W H E R E Y ° U H A N G VOURSELF," © The whole conversation came back to me. For heaven's sake, how would I like to be thrown into a pot of boiling water ? M y way was clear. I went out and bought two gallons of white wine. That evening, m y husband and I poured a gallon of wine into a large pot, placed the pot on the floor and dropped in the first lobster. H e sank into the liquid and started to swim. Then his eyes shot straight up into the air. H e waved his claws wildly, hissed and climbed over the side of the pan onto the floor: an obvious teetotaler. W e put him back in, along with his fellows. This time he partook slightly. The reaction was the same with the others. First, "I wouldn't touch the stuff." Then, "Well, maybe, just o n e —" By the time our guests arrived, the lobsters were lolling about in the wine, eyes weaving, their claws around each other. Then, gradually, all motion slowed, and with a com­m o n sigh they passed out.... Dinner was delicious. The lobsters were sweet and soft. Relaxed, that is. /J-/J-J From the desk of: M, C.

': / '----'--Ch~_;resS:Knight. Director of Agricultural Extension LESSONS FOR HOME ECONOMICS CLUBS Prepared by NORMA J. DAVIS, State Extension Agent in Home Economics ((vVe have reached the point where no woman dares say that her education is finished:' SAMPLE CONSTITUTION ARTICLE I This club shall be known as __ _.__································ . ARTICLE II The object of the club is to study scientific ways of conducting home work in order to preserve the best interests of the family; to discuss the best expenditure These lessons have been especially arranged for the Girls' I-fome Economics Clubs. As the ladies have shown an interest in the lessons, they have been placed in this form for distribution. These lessons may be studied by one person, but much .more may be accomplished and learned if they are read, studied, and discussed by a group of girls or women. The lessons are brief, but may stimulate to further study, thought, exchange of ideas, and the use of reference books. Books on any subject desired may be obtained from Mr..J. D. Layman, Librarian of the University of Nevada, Reno, Nevada. The only expense is the express or postage charge. There is no need to organize a new group if there is a Ladies' Aid Guild, t(Good Grange;' or any other unit in which the ladies are organized, and in which this branch of study may be intro­duced. The meetings held should be formal enough to observe rules of order, and thus to secure strict attention to the program. The meetings may consist of the program and a brief social hour. The simple program of a discussion of the lesson and a musical number or two will stimulate the local talent of the community to further efforts. -The brief social hour may be occupied with conversation that is worth ~hile and with the serving of light refreshments, which may consist of 'coffee or cocoa with sandwiches, ice cream and cake, or fruit salad and sandwiches served on paper plates with paper napkins. tf Daintiness of service with wholesome food, plentiful but not too elab-orate, makes for good cheer:' If a new organization seems most desirable the following sample con-stitution with the outline for the order of, the business may be of assis-tance: -2- of time, strength, and money to secure the higheRt eftlciency; to broaden the out­look of the family through the culture of the mother of the household; to encour­age a social spirit in the community while working together for the good of the family; to consider the home as a part of the community and therefore having relations with church, school, and social well-being; to elevate the character of rural life to the end that the farm home shall be the best in America and most attractive to the rising generation. Any person interested in the foregoing objects for study is eligible for mem-bership. ARTICLE III ~ The officers shall be a President, a Vice-President, a Secretary, a Treasurer, and a Corresponding Secretary. The duty of the President shall be to preside at all meetings and to call extra sessions whenever practicable. The duty of the Vice-President is to act for the President in the absence of the latter or whenever she is unable to attend to her duties. The duties of the Secretary and Treasurer shall be, respectively, to keep minutes of the meetings, and to care for the finances of the club if there be any. The Corresponding Secretary shall give notice of meetings, conduct the cor-0 respondence of the club, send a report of meetings to the Department of Home Economics of the Nevada State College of Agriculture, and write for state and government bulletins that shall aid in the study of the club. ARTICLE IV The majority of the members present at a meeting shall constitute a quorum. ARTICLE V The officers of the club shall constitute an Executive Council, which shall determine the place of meeting and the time and number of meetings and arrange for the year's program. ARTICLE VI The club shall be under the supervision of the Department of Home Economics of the Nevada State College of Agriculture, which department will be ready to assist by answering questions, by aiding in the preparation of a program, and by visiting the clubs for the purposes of teaching. ARTICLE VII ((Roberts's Rules" shall be the guide to parliamentary usage. ORDER OF BUSINESS At regular meetings the order is as follows: 1. Call to order. 2. Roll-call (often omitted, the Secretary noting absentees). 3. Reading of the minutes. 4. Announcements by the President. 5. Statement of Treasurer. Corresponding Secretary.

State the number of times you have made the different soups. 2. State what you think are the essential things to know in making a soup, and also the materials necessary in a soup. 3. 'Vhat is the effect of heat on a mixture of flour and water? 4. Did you notice, in making the tomato soup, the effect of the soda Ii -5- on the t~matoes? T?matoes are acid. Soda is an alkali. "Then they ar~ combIned a chemIcal change occurs which causes the bubbles. The aCId tomato would curdle the milk if the soda were not added. Lesson No.2 SUGARS A subs~ance is called a carbohydrate when it is a compound composed of the mmeral elements, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and the hydro­, nen and oxygen are always present in the proportion of 2: 1. " The thickening agents in the white sauces contain a substance called \starch, which is chemically composed of the mineral elements, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, with hydrogen and oxygen in the proportions of 2: 1. Starch is therefore a carbohydrate. It exists in the form of minute granules which are formed in the plant during its growth. Sugars are carbohydrates because they contain the mineral elements, carbon, hydro­gen, and oxygen in the proportion of 2: 1. Cane sugar, or sucrose, is obtained by extracting the juices from sugar­cane or -beet and boiling the juices down to a state of crystallization. As ~'l,ll the sugar will not crystallize, this liquid is drained off and constitutes 11lolasses. Maple sugar is obtained by boiling down the sap of the maple tree. Grape sugar, or glucose, is widely distributed in nature, and is present in fruits and plant juices. It is not as sweet as cane sugar and does not crystallize as readily. It is sold in the form of a clear, heavy syrup. Fruit sugar, or fructose, occurs with more or less glucose in plant juices, in fruits and especially in honey, of which it constitutes about one-half the solid matter. l\falt sugar, or maltose, is formed from starch and is an important constituent of germinating cereals, malt, etc. Each one of these sugars has been chemically identified. The granu­lated sugar that we use daily is produced from cane and the sugar-beet. This cane and beet sugar (sucrose) can be changed to the grape sugar or glucose when boiled with an acid. Glucose is a sugar which is not easily crystallized. In making fondant care must be taken not to crystallize the mixture. The cream of tartar is an acid that changes the cane sugar to grape sugar (glucose) when the mixture is boiled. FONDANT ~ 5 c sugar. X t cream of tartar. 1;.{ c boiling water. Mix sugar and cream of tartar; add water, stir over hot fire until sugar dis­solves or until mixture almost reaches the boiling-point. As crystals form on inside of pan wash them off by running a fork wrapped in a clean cloth moistened in cold 'water quickly around the inside of the pan. Do not stir or jar during cooking, as sugar grains very easily. Boil until the syrup will form a soft ball in ice-\vater, or, to be more accurate, to 238 degrees F. Then pour the syrup onto a marble or slate slab, or a large oiled platter, that is in a level position where it can remain until cold. Pour slowly, retaining the last bit of syrup in the kettle, as one crystal might cause the whole to crystallize. 'When cool enough to dent with finger, work or stir with a wooden spoon, or pad­dle, until white and creamy. In about ten minutes it will form a stiff mass. 'Vhen you find it beginning to set, knead in hands and place immediately in an oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth or tie oiled paper over the top of bowl. Let fondant stand 24 hours to ripen before using. X pint water. 1 saltspoonful soda. -6- To SHAPE CREAMS Add desired colorings, a little at a time, flavorings, nuts, etc., to ripened fon­dant and knead until mixed. Shape as desired, putting candies as formed on white oilcloth or paraffine paper. To COAT CREAMS To coat chocolate, melt chocolate (Barker's Dot chocolate, Red Label, being best for this) over hot water, adding a few shavings of paraffine if a gloss is desired; remove from water and let cool a little, or until it has slightly thickened. Dip shaped creams into it', using a fork; drain off as much chocolate as POSSibl/~ and put candies on white oilcloth or marble slab. Let stand until firm. ':' PULLED MOLASSES CANDY X pint molasses. 1 lb sugar. 3 T vinegar. X Ib butter. X t cream of tartar. Put the molasses, sugar, water, and vinegar in a saucepan, and stir until the ingredients reach the boiling-point. Add the cream of tartar, and boil until it is very brittle when dropped into cold water. 'Vatch carefully and stir occasionally to prevent scorching. Now add butter and soda. Pour on a greased marble.0 slab or into a pan, and, when sufficiently cool to handle, pull until light in color., Cut into desired shapes. This may be rolled into a long thin strip, the center of the strip filled with cream candy or nut cheese, two strips rolled together and cut with a sharp knife or scissors into buttercups. BUTTER SCOTCH X c molasses. 4 T water. X' c sugar. X' Ib butter. Put all the ingredients into a saucepan, stir until they are thoroughly melted; boil until brittle when dropped into hot water. Pour into a buttered dish and, when cool, break. POPCORS BALLS Pop the corn, sift, and use only the perfect grains. Put the popcorn into a good-sized bowl or pan. To each four quarts allow two cups of sugar, a half cup of water and a rounding tablespoonful of butter. Boil the sugar, water, and butter over the fire until the syrup forms a hard ball when dropped into cold water. Pour this over the popcorn slowly, stirring all the while. Quickly press into balls or squares, and put aside to cool. TURKISH DELIGHT 1 qt granulated sugar. X c candied cherries. ~ X c water. 2 slices candied pineapple. 1 box Knox gelatine (No.1). X Ib almonds. 1 c water. X Ib English walnuts. Juice and grated rind of 1 orange and 1 lemon. Use slow fire. Dissolve sugar in ,2 c water. Cook. 'Vhen it bubbles add gelatine already dissolved in 1 c water. Let boil exactly 10 minutes. Then add juice of 1 lemon and rind and juice of the orange, and let boil 10 minutes longer. Then add nuts and fruits and let all boil up. Do not stir. Pour in tins rinsed in cold water. Let stand 48 hours. Cut into squares and roll in powdered sugar. (Use scissors.) 2 c granulated sugar. X c water. X c corn syrup (scant). DIVINITY 1 t vanilla or few drops of almond or rose. 'Vhite of 1 egg. Nuts and dates may ~e used. -7- Boil sugar, water, and syrup until it hairs well. Then pour syrup over beaten white of egg and beat until creamy, add nuts, dates, flavorings. Put out and let cool. Cut into squares or drop from spoon. QUESTIONS . 1. Determine cost of one pound of the different kinds of candy. Item- Ize cost. . 2. Compare the cost of home-made candy with the cost of factory­made candy. ~ 3. Why is cream of tartar necessary in the recipe of fondant? \ 5. The starch grains when starch is in powdered form should be finely separated by a liquid, or the raw starch in lumps will not be cooked. . CEREALS Cereals absorb water in direct proportion to their weight. For example, 1 cup of rolled oats weighs 3 ozs and requires 3 cups of boiling water. In general, cereals should be cooked as follows: Have the water rapidly boiling. Add 1 t salt for each cup of cereal. Sprinkle the cereal slowly into the water, stirring till it is well mixed, and boil for 5 minutes. Continue the cooking 1 to 8 hours (depending on the cereal) either in a double boiler or with a piece of asbestos under the saucepan. A double boiler may be made by fitting together two pans nearly the same size, putting the larger one on top. The fireless cooker is excellent for cereals. Add cereal to boiling salted water. Boil ten minutes. Put in cooker and allow to stand overnight. Dates, cooked prunes or other fruit cut into small pieces may be stirred into the cereal before serving. A good plan for developing a flavor in cereals is to cook the cereal the evening before, for 30 minutes, put 1 T water on top at night, and next .-L7'\ morning heat through before stirring and cook 20 to 30 minutes longer. rr- ' You do not run the risk of having lumpy cereal if you wait until it is well heated through before stirring it.

How is starch identified in foods? 4. State clearly the principles involved in cooking cereals. Lesson No.5 CARBOHYDRATES-VEGETABLES General Composition of Vegetables-Most plants used for food, with the exception of cereals, legumes (peas, beans, and lentils), and nuts contain a large amount of water and refuse matter. The tables of the compo­sition of vegetables and cereals show us that the percentage of carbohy­drates (starches, sugars, and cellulose or the woody fiber) is higher than either the protein or the fat percentages. So we speak of vegetables as carbohydrate food. Peas and beans are vegetables which have a com­paratively high protein content. Also, the ash or mineral matter which all vegetables contain gives them a very important place in the daily diet. Thus vegetables are important in the diet because they furnish the body with the following important things: 1. \Vater. 2. Starch and sugars, which give heat and energy and produce flesh in the body. 3. Cellulose, which strengthens the muscles of the digestive tract. 4..Mineral matter for the cells and juices of the body. 5. Flavor, which stimulates the appetite. PARTS OF PLANTS USED FOR FOOD Roots: Beets, carrots, turnips, radishes, sweet potatoes. Tubers: \Vhite potatoes, Jerusalem artichokes. Bulbs: Onions, garlic. Stems: Asparagus, celery, rhubarb. Leaves: Cabbage, lettuce, Brussels sprouts, beet greens, watercress, spinach. Flowers: Cauliflower. Fruit or seeds: Peas, beans, wheat and the grains, cucumbers, egg plant, squash. Fungi: Mushrooms, puff balls. ~\ P1~rpose: 1. To soften, separate and sometimes break down the cellulose or woody tissue. 2. To allow the starch grains present to absorb water, swell and burst. 3. To slightly harden protein. 4. To develop flavors and remove strong disagreeable odors. Sweet-juiced vegetables, such as peas, beans, carrots, corn, potatoes" beets, parsnips, tomatoes, and squash, should be cook~d slowly and closely covered in a small quantity of water, so as to aVOId loss of flavor by evaporation. . . Strong-juiced vegetables, such as cabbage, caulIflower, onlOns: and turnips, should be cooked quickly in a large quantity of water In an uncovered vessel. If the flavor is very strong, these vegetahles should be cooked in two or more waters. -14- Vegetables should be fresh, crisp, and firm to give good results. The water in which they are to be cooked should be boiling hot Defore the vegetables are put into it. The addition of about){ t soda helps to soften old tough vegetables. The water must be changed if soda is used. The addition of salt when vegetable is first put on to cook is said to toughen the cellulose. In spinach if salt is added at first the spinach retains fresh green color.

If desired, cut whole vegetables in cubes, quarters, or slices. Season with butter, salt and pepper to taste. '\Varmed milk may also be added to asparagus, string beans, corn, cabbage~ and onions. 2. Sauted. To saute, cook vegetables in a small quantity of hot fat in a frying pan. Raw tomatoes should be dredged with flour and seasoned with pepper and salt before sauteing. 3. Creamed. Serve vegetables with medium white sauce (1 c liquid, 2 T thickening, 2 T fat). 4. Escalloped. Place creamed vegetable in a baking dish; cover with buttered crumbs; brown in oven. l~ Ii \ .. -15- RECIPES POTATOES Au GRATIN Slice 3 c potatoes, sprinkle with 1 t salt and 7{ t pepper; make 2 cups of white sauce. Put potatoes and sauce in alternate layers in a baking dish, having sauce for the top layer. Bake twenty-five minutes or until brown. Grated cheese, chopped green pepper, sliced hard-boiled eggs, or I T minced onion may be added to the layers. To Butter Crumbs: To I T melted butter, add % c fine bread~rnmbs. Mix ,r-.::, well. . BOILED CABBAGE Remove outer leaves, cut cabbage in quarters or eighths and soak one-half hour in cold water with 1 t salt. Put into a large kettle nearly filled with rapidly boiling water; add 7{ t soda. Cook 20 minutes uncovered. Drain, cover again with boiling water. Cook 20 minutes or until tender, but do not overcook. Drain; serve as desired. A white sauce may be poured over it; salt, pepper, and butter may be added, or it may be served with Hollandaise sauce. HOLLANDAISE SAUCE Put a bit of bay leaf and I T chopped onion into 2 T vinegar; bring to the (~ boiling-point, then cool. Melt 2 T butter. Add 1 T flour and when well blended add gradually 1 cup boiling water. Stir until boiling, then add strained vinegar. Take from the fire and stir in gradually the yolks of 2 eggs. Heat very gently just a moment. Add X t salt and a dash of pepper; pour over the vegetable and serve at once. This is good to serve with fish.

Board of Regents Report 1942-1944 Page 115; REPORT OF TPIE UNIVERSITY OP NEVADA 115 tjall. Additional chairs were provided from the stock of folding chairs owned bj^ the University. Since these chairs were of weak construc¬ tion, there was a considerable amount of wear and tear and breakage. Among the items of maintenance paid for by the Army were the complete reconditioning and painting of the third floor, the hallways and stairways, and all exposed floors in Manzanita Hall. Linoleum floor covering was provided in Manzanita Hall and Lincoln Hall, reduc- ino- the wear and tear on the hardwood floors. Two davenport and chair sets in Manzanita and one set in Lincoln Hall were provided at Army expense. The Army also required and paid for the installations of shades on all study lights in Manzanita and Lincoln Halls. Considering the number of men involved and the length of time they occupied the quarters, the amount of damage to the University property was not abnormal. In the .summer of 1943, considerable damage was done to the screens in Manzanita Hall, and some of the blackboards in the New Gymnasium were damaged by dart games played against them. On several occasions, the Coordinator had to protest to the Com¬ manding Officer about the method and amount of scrubbing done on ' the hardwood floors in Manzanita and Lincoln Halls. The linoleum on the floor helped somewhat to remedy this problem. With one or two exceptions only, the Army officers were very cooperative in helping to care for University property. Messing. The problem of converting the University Dining Hall into an Army Mess Hall was tremendous. Only through the competence and dili¬ gence of the Managing Chef, James Grayson, and the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, Carl Horn, was the task accomplished with no interruption or shortage in the messing program. Many items of new equipment were added, including the following: A new dishwash¬ ing machine, a new milk and butter refrigerator, new coffee urns, steam tables, pot washing sinks, metal trays, tray carts, baking ovens, fish storage refrigerator, ice cream storage box, large quantities of cooking utensils, dishware, and tableware. Additional tables and chairs had to be provided. The men were fed in cafeteria style, passing in front of the steam tables with trays and silverware, being served by a line of mess attend¬ ants. An accurate time-table of flights was maintained so that there would be no halting of the line. As the men filled a table, they ate, carried their trays out the south entrance of the Mess Hall, and passed out the door. Their places were immediately taken by a new flight. ^ continuous stream poured through the Mess Hall. More than six hundred men passed the steam tables in approximately thirty-four J^inntes. The seating capacity of two hundred eighty enabled all men 0 have approximately twenty minutes for eating. As the dishes were urned in by the men, attendants cleaned and stacked them and wheeled em to the dishwashing room. Other attendants cleared the tables for the next flight. as, contracts with the Army called for using the Army Master Menu aet^ ^^i*ie. It was the policy of the staff to serve always, if not the Ma^ 1, ™^^^^'' menu, its equivalent or better. During the months of ^ch, April, and May of 1943, it was necessary to feed civilians as L;  .

THE UNIVERSITY FARM After operating the University Farm under a lease for nearly two years, the Twenty-eighth Legislature in February, 1917, appropriated funds for its purchase. During 1917, 40 acres of land were plowed and seeded to wheat, barley, oats, and potatoes, 13 acres to alfalfa, with wheat as a nurse crop, and the remainder of the farm was utilized for hay and pasture. The production included: Hay, 189 tons; oats, 7,860 pounds; barley, 12,080 pounds; wheat, 45,345 pounds, potatoes, 12 tons. In 1918 40 acres were seeded to alfalfa, with wheat as a nurse crop, 5 to barley, 10 to oats, 1 to potatoes, % ^-cre to sunflowers, and V2 acre to sugar-beets, the remainder of the farm being utilized for hay and pasture. The production included: Hay, 200 tons; wheat, 54,315 pounds; barley, 7,065 pounds; oats, 17,485 pounds; potatoes, 6 tons; sunflowers, 29,650 pounds; alfalfa silage, 41,630 pounds; and sugar-beets, 4,500 pounds. A new 70-ton redwood stave silo was erected and filed with sunflower and alfalfa silage. Two 85-foot additions to cattle sheds were con¬ structed, utilizing the labor of the Soldiers' Vocational Section of the ^- A. T. C. One old shed was torn down and removed to the new group of farm buildings. Considerable labor was expended in straightening ditches and improving the system of irrigation. Operations and Maintenance of the Farm—Permanent plans for the operation of the farm have been made and followed for the past three years, with the result that over 80 acres are now producing their maxi- jnum of crops. Plans have likewise been formulated for the permanent 'Ocation of farm buildings. The farm has a capacity for producing;  .

The economy crunch: a multimedia website devoted to the economy and what we eat; What we eat speaks volumes about who we are. Diet can be a reflection of one’s unique tastes, economic class or personal style. It’s hard to stay true to your diet, whatever it may be, when money is tight and buying everything you want or need is no longer an option.The Economy Crunch website is a multimedia Masters thesis project. The aim of the project was to create a full website devoted to how the state of the economy affects what people eat as well as what people are doing to eat well during a recession.The website is informative yet fun to navigate through and interactive. The site combines text, photography and video story formats as well as different multimedia and online story telling tools like Vuvox an interactive collage tool, Google maps and information graphics.; The website is located at http://www.jennharris.net/economycrunch/. The homepage consists a story carousel with four main featured stories, meant to give insight into how different groups are dealing with the economy in terms of diet. There is also a link to a recipe section, a cheap eats section and a page devoted to the Banh Mi sandwich. These pages are meant to give helpful information regarding eating on a budget.The first story is The Urban Garden, about how Mirabelle restaurant in Los Angeles is saving money and keeping green by growing most of their produce organically at the Solano Community garden in Los Angeles. The story consists of two videos shot and edited by me, using iMovie. The videos were put into a Flash player, which is how they are presented on the web.The first video features Mirabelle restaurant manager Michael Duddie, who speaks about the start of his restaurant supported agriculture movement, where restaurants grow their own produce in gardens to reduce carbon footprints and save money. Duddie also gives a sort of walking tour of the different parts of the garden. Los Angeles Garden Council Director Al Renner also speaks in the video regarding the garden.; In the second video, Duddie introduces viewers to composting with a demonstration. This story features two extra story elements in addition to the videos. The first is a Google map with community gardens in Los Angeles and the second is an information graphic, built using Photoshop and Dreamweaver. The information graphic is a step-by- step demonstration, with picture icons, of how community supported agriculture works from your home, to the farm, back to your home.The second feature story located in the carousel is Chefs in the Classroom. This story is about the Los Angeles Unified School District’s Network for a Healthy California program Chefs in the Classroom. This program sends professional chefs to schools to teach the students and teachers how to cook healthful food.The article focuses on the visit of professional chef Billie Sutton to the Ellen Ochoa Learning Center Middle School in Cudahy, CA. Sutton does a cooking demonstration for a group of teachers, who plan to take their newly learned recipe and teach it to their students in class.; In the article, readers hear from Sutton, a couple teachers participating at the school, the director of the Chefs in the Classroom program and the head of the Network for a Healthy California. This story features two extra story elements. The first is a Google map that shows the dense population of fast food restaurants around the school in relation to the few supermarkets. The second is a full cooking demonstration by Sutton, shot on a flip camera, edited with flip share software and posted on YouTube.The third story in the carousel is about a woman who completed a food stamp challenge, why she did it and what her experience was like. Her seven-day task is chronicled along with the difficulties she faced.The article focuses on the challenge to stay healthy on a limited budget such as the allotment given to a person participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. In this article, readers hear from Katie Evarts, the woman who completed the challenge, Cecilia Chan, Resident Dietician at the Huntington Memorial Hospital and Regan Hoper, Public Affairs Specialist for the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Services.; Chan comments from a dietician’s point of view in regards to how healthy a person participating in SNAP can be. Hoper gives a voice to the people that run SNAP and how they are dealing with the state of the economy in relation to the funds people participating in SNAP receive.This story features one multimedia component. It is an interactive collage meant to explain the history of the food stamp and landmarks in the food stamp program. It also chronicles the amount of money food stamp participants are given for food in relation to food prices for basic foods like milk and bread. The interactive collage features photographs and text, made with Vuvox.The fourth article is a broadcast television package on the state of the wine industry and how the failing economy is actually good for wine consumers. I shot, edited and did the voice overs for the package using Avid NewsCutter as the editing software.; In the package, viewers hear from two wine boutique owners regarding their wine selection and how the economy is affecting their business as well as what consumers should look for in terms of good buys. A wine enthusiast is also featured speaking about her consumer habits and how she is adjusting to her new budget. This article features one multimedia element other than the video. A Google map displays a list of wine bars in Los Angeles. There is also a list of links to wine recommendations.In addition to the four featured stories, there are five other pages with content that will help people eat well during a recession. The first is a recipe section with one recipe highlighted as well as a recipe box of archived recipe articles. All recipes were written with health and a budget in mind and come from my weekly food column called The Food Chronicles, written for USC Annenberg’s digital news publication Neon Tommy.There is also a cheap eats section with my picks for the top five cheap eats restaurants in Los Angeles. For each restaurant chosen there is a small picture, a mini review and all necessary contact information for the restaurant. To give viewers more cheap eats options, there is also a table with links to Los Angeles magazine’s 101 cheap eats.; There is a full section devoted to food photography. Reading about food definitely makes an impact, but seeing food in a visual representation elicits more of a response both physically and emotionally.I wanted to demonstrate to viewers the beauty that can be seen in what we eat, even if we can’t really taste it. All pictures were taken with a Nikon Coolpix and Canon Rebel XSi 5D camera.A full page is devoted to the Banh Mi sandwich, a Vietnamese traditional sandwich that combines traditional French and Vietnamese influences. The sandwich is featured for its affordability and exceptional taste.; The page explains what a Banh Mi sandwich is using an information graphic that was built using Photoshop and Dreamweaver. The graphic explains each part of the sandwich. There is also an interactive collage that explains the origins of the sandwich and where consumers can buy it, including two restaurants. The interactive collage was made using Vuvox.The entire website was coded by hand using Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Flash and BBedit. All video, Vuvox collages and information graphics were built by me for the website. All photographs were taken by me unless otherwise credited by Flickr Creative Commons.;  .

Jewish Heritage Collection: Oral history interview with Bertha Lazarus Breibart; Bertha Lazarus Breibart, daughter of immigrants Louis and Rose Lazarus (Lazarowitz), discusses growing up in Charleston and Summerville, South Carolina, in the 1920s and ’30s. Louis arrived in New York in 1902, worked as a tailor, and, later, his wife and their first child, Max, joined him. The family moved to Charleston, where Louis ran a shoe repair shop in various locations on King Street. When they moved to Summerville, he reopened on Main Street. Bertha remembers that her father struggled to make a living; they were a “very poor family,” one that included three brothers, Max, Morris, and Herman, all much older than Bertha. The family traveled to Charleston to attend holiday services at Brith Sholom, one of Charleston’s two Orthodox synagogues. Bertha recalls the traditional foods her mother made, their Jewish neighbors in Charleston and Summerville, and her experiences attending Summerville public schools. When she was eighteen she represented Summerville in Charleston’s 1935 Azalea Festival beauty contest and won. Bertha attended AZA and B’nai Brith dances and other social events in Charleston, and on one of her many visits to the city, she met her husband, George Breibart.

Interview of Ernestine Reems, [s.d.]; Interview with Ernestine Reems. She was born on June 7, 1929 and grew up in Oklahoma. Her father was a traveling evangelist, traveling through Kansas, Oklahoma, eventually migrating to Richmond, CA. He preached in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and other towns. Mr. and Mrs. Farthing, her principal at school, took her under their wing when she was between seven and eight years old. She came to the Bay area with Bishop Samuel Crouch, who told her she would be a missionary. She sings small fractions of a few of her favorite songs growing up. "What a Friend We Have in Jesus" is possibly her most favorite from childhood. Bishop Crouch was very well educated, and kept church organized but never kept the congregation late, and so the youth would go to another church in the evenings. Her style of preaching comes from her father's example. He taught mainly in parables, and spoke so plainly that even the children could understand.; Unlike her father, she attended Bible college. Her mother was a humble, quiet, and sweet woman. She was an excellent cook, and many memories include baking or cooking other things in the kitchen. Her father's church, the Ephesian Church of God in Christ was the largest of it's kind in the Bay area for many years. Her dad let her preach her first sermon when she was fifteen years old. Though the Church of God in Christ denomination would not allow its members to dance, drink, smoke, play ball, etc. she feels blessed to have had the background and sweet people surrounding her. She had a difficult time starting out in her ministry, because people did not support women preaching, especially in the Church of God in Christ. She made the decision to become independent in order to serve the poor and bring in others who do not know Christ from the community. She calls herself a real woman of faith; she bought her first church building and paid for it in five years "with no one but Ernestine and the Lord".; She owns 140 units which she negotiated for ten years that go toward low income people. She tells the tale of how the former landlord was inspired by her zeal and told her he would will the property to her after he died, if she would just give him a dollar. Though she agreed, he passed away that very afternoon and her struggle continued in pursuit of the housing. She eventually got the property with a developer with the help of the mayor. Worship is the central idea in her spiritual experience. She is the aunt of Tremaine Hawkins. Her goal throughout life was to put faith in God, no matter what she did. She feels a great need for young people to have people to look up to, and wants to set an example by her life of what she preaches. Her favorite song, her song of praise is "My Soul Loves Jesus".; Gospel singers, Reems, Ernestine.

Kitchen in Cheney Dining Hall, c. 1974; A photograph the inside of the kitchen of the Springfield College Cheney dining hall, c. 1974. The photograph depicts two chefs preparing food in the kitchen, surrounded by various machines and a large mixing bowl with food in it. Cheney Hall opened on April 1, 1968, replacing the existing cafeteria, Woods Hall, and increasing the serving capacity from 300 to 800 per sitting. The new facility was dedicated on June 15, 1968 to Ralph L. Cheney, class of 1901, and R. William Cheney, class of 1933, a father and son who were very influential at Springfield College. The 26,500 sq. ft. facility has a semi-circular wall curving outward at the front, which adds 45’ of depth to the building. Originally the building included a covered portico following this curve, which provided shade and shelter to students; however, in 2005 the portico was enclosed for extra seating. In addition, there are two separate and smaller dining areas, which can seat up to 110 extra people. Today, these rooms are called Cheney rooms A & B and are used by faculty and staff to hold special functions. In an attempt to keep up with other colleges, Springfield College and Aramark, the school’s food service company, made renovations to the dining hall in 2004. These changes included a more expansive seating area with two different levels of seating and various stations with different types of food. The renovations also allowed students to pay for a meal upon entry and eat as little, or as much, as desired.;  .

Correspondence of June 1976 to and from Lorenzo A. Richards; June 11, 1976 Dear Ren and Zilla. You certainly won the race to St. George, I was aware that you pulled out from here around k a.m. It is certainly a quiet engine to your motorhome, but I. am also a. light sleeper. We left about 8:30 a.m. and were in St. George by k p.m. Glad to hem? that all went well on your trip and you arrived in good time for the session at the polls on Tuesday a.m. You should have stayed longer here; there was enough leeway in timing. We are much indebted to you for the artichokes; meant to tell you while we were at the cabin that I took along one jar av/3 put them into the salad; it really jazzed up the salad, and we'll be making good use of the remaining eleven jars in the weeks to come, esp. for salads. I note there are recipes inside the lid and in the interests of gourmet cooking we111 be reading and maybe trying them. My folks were fine; weather not too hot; evenings ¥isxy cool and early mornings especially lovely. We drove to Kolob Canyons with them (the turn off several miles south from Cedar City.) Another day my mother went with us and we did Kolob Reservoir; fascinating countryside. Had lunch at Springdale; bought cherries in LaVerkiri. Me drove home on 89, so visited Information Center at Xion; picked up a marvelous flower book, and a colored chart of the geologic strata. After Ephraim?- we turned off at Spring City, as we had heard there are ai lot of stone houses there; and there are* A light stone. Narrow dirt roads for much of the city streets, and the irrigation water tumbling down steep inclines over natural rooks; it was muddy from recent rains, and a farmer with a shovel Was trying to get some of it under control.

Heisig, Deputy Administrator, Economic Research Service, USDA, Washington, D.C., made the following conclusions: Geographic adjustment in animal agriculture in the future, as in the past, will be influenced importantly by demand changes created by population increases and shifts among regions, by changing consumer preferences, by differences among regions in rate of adaptation of new technologies and skills, availability of non-animal in­come alternatives and by locational advantages due to transportation, cost of feed, feeder animals and the final product itself. A. J. Berwick, public relations, Doane Agricultural Service, Inc., Aurora, Illinois, had the following comments as he spoke on management adjustments in agribusinesses for 19BO: 1. Fewer, but larger, farms; therefore, fewer people in agriculture. 2. Higher capital investment per unit and thus more outside capital required for financing. 3. Type of ownership will change in regard to farms and ranches; however, the family-type operation will still continue to play an important role. 4. Probably less diversification by farm operators thus leading to more speciali­zation. 5. The future role of the ~overnment in agriculture is perhaps the largest question and the one that is most difficult to predict. A. J. Berwick had the following suggestions to people in agriculture: 1. To be a businessman rather than technician or specialist. 2. To rely more on advise from the specialists either within or outside your business. 3. Have the ability to fit together the various factors that control the business into a logical pattern. 4. Be well read and know what others are doing so you can improve your operation. 5. Form an alliance with your banker for guidance in use of money. 6. Keep, or have kept, good records on your business. 7. Buy more services on a job specification basis. B. Last but not least, be a good public relations specialist, -1- JULY 1965 What will be in the meat counters by 1980? Summarized from the comments of S. Seth T. Shaw, Marketing Consultant, Washington, D.C., and John Helgeson, Food Marketing Manager, Better Homes and Gardens, Des Moines, Iowa. The following factors or trends of everyday living have a bearing on what will be in the meat counters available to the consumer in the future. 1. Eating out is bf'coming more important. 2. The search for new flavors or striving for flavor combinations is a powerful force in today's market along with a flair for foreign food. 3. Home entertainment is growing. 4. Make-ahead food preparation to aid or ease in meal preparation. 5. Creative cooking is paramount in cooking today which extends from the desire to simplify meals with more focus on eye and taste appeal. 6. Emphasis on dieting. More manufacturers are offering a variety of produce with quality and flavor which make dieting more of a pleasure and less of a torture. 7. Interest in gpod ~ating never has been higher and more money is being spent on over 8 thousand items available today in the modern supermarket. Beef Cattle: The trend seems to be that the future of beef cow numbers will increase throughouc the Nation but the increase in anyone region will not far out-distance any other. Increasing demand in the West will cause a flow of cattle in that direction and of grains to feed them out; however, a large portion of the population and demand will remain in the East~rn states. Consequently, the surplus of feed in the Corn Belt and Northern Plains will continue to feed most of the cattle sent East. Increasing supplies of forage and roughage will keep cow-calf production increasing in the South. -2- YEARLING CATTLE GAINS ON NATIVE RAJilGE FORAGE AND BUNCHED HAY (Summarized from the 1965 Progress Report.,.Research in Beef Cattle Nutrition and Management, Squaw Butte Experiment Station, Burns, Oregon, March, 1965), Gains of yearling cattle drop from better than 2 pounds a day in May and June to less than a pound a day in August. Supplementation studies with animals on both native and crested wheatgrass range forage have indicated that yearling cattle can be supplemented for profitable gain during the period when forage quality and quantity is adequate to provide gains of about one pound or more per day. Sometime between the first and the middle of August, forage quality from native feed is generally so low that supplementing to maintain a constant rate of gain is not economical. There is little to be gained by leaving yearling cattle on the range after this time, They should be removed from the range and the forage utilized to maintain the breeding herd. Forty-five yearling animals were separated by weight into 3 groups of 15 each. Each group was randomly allotted to one of 3 range grazing treatments: (1) range forage alone, (2) range forage plus adequate nutrient supplementation to provide for mainte­nance and gain of 2.25 pounds and (3) the same as treatment 2 except that additional energy was supplemented during the time the moisture content of the forage was high. Five animals from each supplementation treatment were taken off the range and put on bunched meadow hay on July 22 and August 12. Each group of animals grazed in separate 160-acre native range pastures, but during the time they were on bunched hay, the animals were in the same field. Table 1. Animal Gains for Time Intervals however, after adjus~1ng to hay the group which was on bunched hay from July 22 gained 0.47 pounds more per head daily by October 1 than did the animals on range forage during that time. The animals that were moved to bunched hay on August 12 gained 0.18 pounds per day more than those on range forage during the period from August 12 to October 1. It is indicated that range forage quality was above average as a result of the late season rains and cattle gains from range feed alone were above normal during this period; therefore, greater differences between supplemented and unsupplemented cattle and between those moved to bunched hay and those remaining on range should be expected in years with less summer range. The results of this study indicate that yearling cattle will do better in late July, August and September on good quality, bunched, meadow hay than on range forage under the conditions of this research which is comparable to Nevada forage conditions where no high range feed is available. There is a depression in gains for about the first 2-3 weeks while the animals are adjusting to the feed change, which indicates that putting animals on bunched hay for a short period of time would not be profitable. Therefore, it would be better to sell yearlings directly off the range rather than move them to bunched hay for a short feeding period. -4- SOCIAL DOMINANCE AND ITS EFFECT ON SUPPLEMENTATION OF RANGE COWS (Summarized from Kenneth A. Wagnon1s speech at the University of California, Davis, Sheep & Beef Day, March 27, 1965). Ranchers are aware that beef cattle have a social dominance behavior pattern. Each animal establishes and maintains its position within the herd by fighting with its associates. When we supplement a mixed age group during winter feeding in Nevada, or even on the range, what assurance do we have that each animal gets their share? Animals most commonly on the bottom of the social pattern are chased away from the feed. These animals are usually the younger animals such as first-calf heifers which have a higher requirement for feed since they are still growing. Research at the University of California on hand feeding of supplements showed that 2 and 3 year old heifers either gained more weight or lost less weight when separated from the rest of the herd. In hand feeding they also encountered another problem which involved getting the animals to come to the feeding area. It is important to call the animals and bring those not responding to the feeding area to adjust equal consumption for each animal. In a 5 year study they found that 83.9% came to the feeding area. Between age groups, the 4 year olds showed the lowest response to call. Changes of forage, hay feeding or calving also influenced response to call for extra feed. Many ranchers have gone to self-feeders to supplement cattle of mixed ages. Generally, salt is used as a regulator with grain or cottonseed. Wagnon also re­ported on studies using this supplementation procedure. The effec~ of age differences on tolerance of salt is illustrated by data from three age classes of cattle that were fed for approximately a 150 day period. The average daily consumption intake per head of salt was 0.39 pounds for 8 month old heifers, 0.65 pounds for 2 year old heifers and 0.89 pounds for a mixed age group of cows that varied from 3 through 10 years of age. These data show marked variation in salt consumption in and among the 3 classes of cattle. The average daily use of the salt suppl~ment feeder was 12.6 hours per day by 98.2% of the cattle. There was noted a tendency for a greater number of the cattle low in the social dominance to make their initial visit to the self-feeder before noon when there was les~ competition for its use. The young cows gained an average of 37 pounds prior to calving as compared to 70 pounds for the older animals. The younger age cows spent an average of 5 minutes less daily eating at the self-feeder thus having a 23% less pre-calving weight gain as compared to the older cows of higher social dominance. This salt supplement experiment substantiates the need for adequate water located close to the feediag unit. About 74% of the cows drank before they went to the self­feeder and of these 73% watered again just before leaving the area to graze. Around 4% of the cows watered four times a day, 18% three times daily, 57% twice and 21% once daily. When using a salt supplement mi~ture on dry forage, it is very im­portant that a plentiful supply of water is conveniently located. -5-;  .

Butler,K_OH5_002; Abstract: This is an oral history of Keith Hodson Butler. It was conducted March 1, 2007 and concerns his recollections of the history of the Marriott-Slaterville area. KB: I’m Keith Hodson Butler. I go by the middle initial of “H.” Both are prominent names within in the Marriott-Slaterville area, the Hodson’s and the Butler’s. My father was Carl L. Butler who was born and raised where Defense Depot Ogden (DDO) presently is. The 12th street entrance to DDO is where the family grew up. My grandmother on his side, my dad’s side, was a Hadley. Of course, my dad was a Butler. It really spreads out from there. My mother was Bernice Hodson and she grew up where the present Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building is, on the south side of 12th street. She was a Stanger. Her grandmother was a Stanger which the Stangers are very prevalent around this country too. We lived in my grandmother’s house who was Jane Sharp Stanger. We lived at the house that is still standing across from Pilot Oil, the white house that is still there on 12th street. That is where I was born and raised. Right in that vicinity there were three houses that we rented off and on. My grandmother Stanger who was my idol, she was a tough rascal. She was one of those pioneers that came across as a pioneer. She had diabetes in her later years and was eighty-four years old when she died. She was tougher than you could ever ask for. She owned the house, and back in those days it was the depression when I was born, and we lived with her, my dad, my mother, and I. In the next three or four years we had two more children, my brother Jay and my sister Carlene. Like I said, we lived there and there were three houses across the street where, and Pilot Oil is presently, there was a house there. Bill Hipple owned that house. It was a little two room house and we rented there, and right up the street where the present freeway goes through there was another house owned by the Halverson’s. We lived there until 1945 and I was fifteen at that time. That is when we moved over into Slaterville on 1200 West and that is where the rest of my family was raised. In fact, when my folks died, my sister bought the house and she still lives in that house. As far as going back to my younger days, I remember, like I said, the depression—it was tough times. My dad was working for what was then the Works Projects Administration (WPA). He was making I think forty-eight dollars a month. The WPA was a public works association, one that I think President Roosevelt set up to help these people because there were just no jobs available at that time. That is where they set up projects, put in outdoor—you might call them restrooms—but they were outdoor toilets. They built the cement platform and built the outdoor toilets. They were even doing some work with the Forest Service. They would go up and work in the mountains making rock fireplaces. Some of those are still there. As a little kid, I went with my dad a number of times during the day while they were building those outdoor fireplaces. That kind of faded out and it even got worse. My dad would go haul hay, throw hay on wagons all day long from daylight till dark for Clifford Blair. Where we are presently in our City Hall, he ended up owning this property here and handed it down through his children and they donated it to our city. Dad would go out and work all day hauling hay. We didn’t have a car back in those days. He had a bicycle with a basket on the front. We had to go up to 12th and Washington. He would ride the bike up to 12th and Washington to what they called Floyd Barnett’s little grocery store. He would get what he could with what little money we had and he would bring it back. We were so tickled the time when he would come back—by then I had a brother and a sister—and he would come back and might have two or three small candy bars or nickel candy bars or a pack of gum that was good. We were tickled to death to get a candy bar or a stick of gum because we didn’t know any better. That was all we knew of at that time. It was pretty rough slaying back in those days. In fact, I remember going out with my dad. The railroad tracks ran down parallel with 12th street to the west into San Francisco out of Ogden and back in those days the old steam engines would go through there and they would load the coal on the train. Of course, they would sway back and forth and a lot of time lumps of coal would fall off from the railcars and my dad and I—I would go with him—I couldn’t help him much because I was real little—but we would take a gunnysack and go along and pick up this coal. This was what we used in our old coal stoves to heat our water and do our cooking. We didn’t have much ground so we would raise a few cows and we had our own pig and cow and chickens. It was pretty tough going in those days. We would herd the cattle. I remember on the right-of-way on the railroad track, we would let our cattle go out there to feed on the grass that was between the rails themselves and the fence to try and make a go of it. I was a very little kid at that time and my dad was sitting on the rails just talking and I will always remember this, he was sitting on the rails watching the cows waiting for the train. When a train came we had to herd them back into our property so they didn’t get scared and run or anything. Lightning hit somewhere down the track quite a ways away and it really tickled our butts really good. We decided that wasn’t a good idea if it was cloudy or if it looked stormy in any way we didn’t sit on any more rails after that. Anyway, a little later—of course, my grandmother was getting older—this was my great-grandmother Stanger that I am talking about that owned that property. One of the things that I will remember too as a kid—back in those days, whenever you had the measles or chicken pox the health department would come around with a sign and tack it up on your pillar or the front of your house and if you had the measles it would be a red sign and it said “measles.” Everybody was supposed to stay away from them. In those days the only thing we had to do was visit neighbors. That was really our entertainment, to go to our neighbors as families and talk and run around with the neighbor kids and that. A lot of times it seemed like there was always a sign of some sort—chicken pox, mumps, measles, or something hanging on somebody’s door so we had to be careful. One other thing, when I was small and living in that house. I couldn’t have been very old; we had a pretty good earthquake. I think it was 1936. That was the only time I can remember an earthquake—well, a couple since then but that was a pretty good-sized earthquake. It shook so much it shook a lot of the dishes off the old cabinets we had. It is a lot different than it is nowadays with the locks and whatever. I remember that as a youth. Dad would milk the cows and we would listen to the radio and I remember the old fights. Max Schmeling and those guys fights and we would listen to the fights while we were milking cows and out in the barn. Quite a unique thing is the neighbor to our west was Bill James. He had a daughter that was deaf. She tended us as little kids. She would come over and listen to the radio by putting her hand on the radio. It was so unique I remember that as plain as day. While she was tending us we would listen to the radio, Jack Armstrong’s—of course, nobody today knows what we are talking about—Red Rider and Hop Along Cassidy and all those that were on in those days, Fibber McGee and Molly and Jack Benny, all those were on. That is the entertainment we had but I remember sitting there next to the radio with her hand on the radio. What she heard in that I don’t remember, but she would do that. I go back a little bit more to when I was talking about the place that we lived at Bill Hipple’s house. It was across the street and was just a real small house. It was old and linoleum floors and I remember so vividly that this home had two real small bedrooms, a living room, and a pantry. Of course, everything was outside, the water, the toilets and everything was outside. They didn’t have anything inside the house. The things that I remember are the windows back in those days when we would get these east winds that come down 12th street in the winter time with the snow. The snow was sometimes blowing or just the wind the curtains would stand almost straight out because there would be so much cold coming in through those windows. I remember my dad would try to bank the old coal stove, we had to have the kindling which was when you would cut up the wood into small pieces so when you put the paper it would start to burn and then you would put the coal in and get the fire going and the heater or the kitchen stove where we did our cooking and what hot water we had. Anyway, he would get up in the morning and bank the fire as best he could to keep it as warm as you could during the night but by morning it would almost be out. I would hear him get up and shake the grate to try and get the coal embers to burst into flame and try to warm it up again. Those cold floors were pretty tough. The blankets—mom would have these quilts that she would make. They were so heavy. Once you got in bed you couldn’t roll over because of the weight of them. They would just mash you down. My brother and I slept together at that time and we were both very small. That was quite an experience there. Like I said, all the plumbing was outside, there was no plumbing inside. Of course we had our cow and chicken and that. This is a little personal thing. My mother always claimed that I hate wind, especially east winds, violent winds. Apparently, I just barely remember, I was looking out the back window when we were having one of these awful wind storms and my dad was out in the barn and it was all old and rickety and gunnysacks hanging on doors about ready to fall down anyway. They did fall down. With the east wind the barn blew down. I was scared my dad was in there but thank goodness he wasn’t. It killed our pig. That left an impression on me that ever since that—I don’t know if that is really the truth or not, but I don’t like winds, high winds. From there we moved up the street a ways on 12th street there. It was just a little narrow street. There weren’t ten cars a day that came down 12th street there. It was where presently the freeway intersects over 12th street, and there was a house that we rented there. It was a bigger house. It was really something in those days. There were high ceilings, twelve foot ceilings. I think they were twelve. It would have one cord hanging down from the ceiling which was your light. There was no power or wall plugs or anything like that. We had a cooking stove where my mother would do the cooking. There was a reservoir on the end of these cooking stoves with water. The heat from the stove would heat the water. The thing that I remember about that was that it was so cold in there we would have our Saturday night bath in a number two which is just a washtub type thing. That is where the three of us—by then my little sister was born or was along with us—the three of us would take a bath in this tub. With the shortage of water, we had to pack the water from across the street so we didn’t waste any water. We would have this number two bathtub, just a galvanized tub and on Saturday night, mom would get an extra boiler or something to put on the stove and try to get enough water. Because my sister was little, and she was a girl, she got to get in the tub first. Then my brother was younger than me so he got in second. Of course we all used the same water. I was third and we just kept adding a little water to it. We’d all get out and about half froze because of the high ceilings and that in the winter time. I would get the one with the old hard water, and there would be a scum on that tub pretty thick. One thing I remember as a kid, we had our chores to do. We had to get the coal and the kindling every night. If you didn’t get it in, when dad would come in to put the stove away for the night, if you didn’t have it, it wasn’t, “Well, we’ll go out and do it tomorrow,” we’d go out and do it then. A lot of times it was pretty darn cold. We had to get the water. We all had our chores. At that time my dad was just beginning to build Hill Air Force Base. He was working the swing shifts so I had to milk the cow. It was across the street from the house that we lived in. We lived on the north side of 12th street presently where the freeway is but the barn was on the other side, the south side of the road. That is where the well was. We had to pack the water across the street. I had to do that because my little brother and sister were too small and I was much bigger and I was the oldest so I had to do it. That was my job every night, to milk the cow and take care of it, feed it, get the water, the kindling and the coal in every night. You weren’t watching TV or anything. There wasn’t anything else to do. This house we are talking about now, it was called the Halverson house. I remember vividly the morning of the 7th of December at the beginning of the war. We were all standing in our front room, standing around the old stove of course, it was the 7th of December, it was pretty cold. The news came over the radio and I remember we all stood around, my uncle and aunt had come over, and as I remember a couple of my aunts and uncles had come by and we all listened to Pearl Harbor being bombed and President Roosevelt talking. I was eleven years old and I remember that vividly, that day, the 7th of December 1941. At about this point of time, like I said, my dad was working at Hill Air Force Base in the evening. They were building the hangers and so forth out there. About that point in time—well let us see, I am getting ahead of myself—we were there a little bit longer than that, and I remember one thing—where the Marriott farm was. Before we moved over to Slaterville, during the war they had the prison camps over here on DDO, the Italians and the Germans prison camp was over there. They needed almost all our guys to fight the war, so the prisoners would go out and work in the beet fields—I remember it specifically over on the south side of the tracks toward the river there. The Marriott’s had a farm there that was being rented by the Hipple’s at that time. Every morning they would bring these prisoners over from the prison camp. Those guys—they didn’t want to go to war. They were happy to be here. They would all be in a state body truck, and there would be one guard with them. I always laugh about the fact that whenever they would pull up in the beet field, and these guys would go to get out, the guard would always go down first, so he would hand the gun to one of the prisoners while he got down off the truck and then the prisoner would hand him the gun and then they would go to work. I always remember that as a kid too. I thought that was quite funny, the fact that they would do that. I would like to give a scenario that I’d give to my grandkids and great-grandkids as they come along. Things are different now than they were when I grew up. I am very conservative. I didn’t have anything as I have stated before. We were so appreciative of a nickel candy bar and if you got a nickel back in those days you were happy. Now you give a kid a ten dollar bill and he looks at you like, “Hey, what am I going to do with this. This can’t buy anything.” Things have changed so much and personally I don’t think it is going the right way. I think that the children of today—back when I grew up my folks didn’t have anything so they couldn’t give us anything. We appreciated everything. Like I said earlier, at Christmas time if we got one item between two of us we were happy. As time went on—my family, my daughter, and then her daughters and now their granddaughters—to me it looks like we are just trying to give them one step better or two steps better than what they had. I think we are going down the wrong road. People don’t appreciate it. At Christmas time it seems like it isn’t what you give, it is how much you give and then it is never enough at that time. I think today we look at when we were tickled to death when we first got married to use hand me downs. When my wife and I got married, I don’t remember us having one piece of furniture that was new. As time went on we would buy a little bit here and there. We always tried to pay as we go type of thing. Of course, there were no credit cards back in those days. We didn’t believe in that, and we still don’t believe in that to speak of. We were satisfied with a small starter home, just enough to get us by until possibly forever. Mine is forever it seems like but it is small. It seems to me like all of our younger people—they want to start out with something that I have worked fifty years for. They want to have a new car, they want a new truck, they want a great big house with vaulted ceilings and brand new furniture and all electronic stuff. They don’t know how they are going to pay for it. I think most of them are just living from day to day. It has just become a materialistic world that is going to be a disaster for us because if, in my view, if we ever have another depression it will be a disaster because the youth of today—the younger people of today have never seen hard times. They have never had to go out and—we were just happy to have a job. Now, they don’t want to work weekends, a lot of them want to go play on weekends, they don’t want to work, they want the best of everything. There will be so many that are so far in debt that they will never get out of it. If we ever have a depression I think there will be suicides all over the place. People could not handle it. I started to work when I was about ten years old helping June Powell on his farm. They had a tractor and I could hardly push the pedal down on the tractor, but my mom and dad, and him and his wife Venice were very close and so he had me come and I’d be on that tractor after school. I would go down and get on the tractor and work until dark disking or something like that. Then we would pick beans and whole beets and tomatoes and all that type of stuff from the time I was ten years old. I have always had two or three jobs all my life. I am seventy-seven years old and I have still got three jobs. I think, not that I am a good person, but that makes better people to work hard and have your goals set to where you are hoping you are doing something for someone to better not only yourself but other people too. When we were kids we used to haul hay, tramp hay on the old hay rack and stuff. Now it seems like you can’t hardly get a kid—unless he is eighteen you can’t get him to work. It’s not all their fault either. A lot of it is because of these laws they have come up with that you have to be a certain age and have a permit to do this and that. Back in those days, the only permit you had to have was to get your butt out of the house in the morning and go. When you get done and it’s dark you come home. My great grandmother—I have a little story about my great grandmother who owned that home that I was talking about earlier on 12th street and we lived with them when I was born in the depression days. As life went on, I loved that lady. She was just a fighter. She was really a sweetheart. I loved her to death. She had diabetes and would give herself a shot every morning. She would crochet and she was just a beautiful lady. She would come live with us in her later years as we got older. One thing that I remember, that I never will forget—she was late 84 or 85 and she was almost on her death bed—my girlfriend, she is my wife now, but at the time she was my girlfriend, we would go up and see her quite often. I would try to get up and see her at least every other week or so. She was living with her daughter. One day, I don’t know how the subject came up and I never will forget it, she was laying there and had diabetes and pretty sick but she said something about Friday. “I wish it was Friday,” or something. She said, “Listen young man. I want to tell you something. Don’t you ever once forget this.” Like I said, she came across the plains. She was a crusty old gal. She said, “I never want you to forget this. If you are thinking about Friday, always wish it was last Friday, not the coming Friday, because you only have so many Fridays in your life.” I never have forgotten that, and that has been probably sixty years ago that she told me that. I can remember that just as if she was whispering it into my ear right now.;  .

Plutus, the Old Main Society Newsletter, Vol. 1 no. 1, June 1999; Plutus Vol. 1 No. 1 JUNE 1999 Commencement 1999 | The last graduating class of the Twentieth j Century was also the earliest in Utah State \ University's history because of USU's change ifrom quarters to semesters. This historic class i of 4,200 graduates heard an Olympic Gold I Medalist at commencement on Saturday M ay |8,1999. | William "Billy" Mills, an orphaned Lakota j Sioux and the only American to win the | Olympic 10,000 meter race, was the j commencement speaker for the 4,200 ! graduates, which included 700 receiving | master's degrees and 247 receiving doctorates Mills, along with four others received honorary degrees at the 106th commencement. Other honorees include Richard Anderson, Reed Bullen, Gordon J. Christensen, and Winnifred C. Jardine. In 1964 Mills represented the United States at the Tokyo Olympics. Leading the 10,000 meter race in the last 300 meters, he stumbled after an accidental push and dropped into third. H e recovered and won, creating one of the biggest upsets in Olympic history and setting a new Olympic record. USU Endowment Management and Investment Practices A n endowment benefits students, programs, and projects at Utah State University forever. The gift that creates an endowment is never spent. Instead, earnings from the invested funds provide support to the University in perpetuity. The University's endowment investment program is managed to maximize earnings, ensure funds to support the donor's objectives, protect the corpus for the future, and to encourage growth to alleviate the effects of inflation. USU manages its individual endowments in one c o m m o n endowment pool. This allows the University to diversify endowment assets, lower the investment risk and increase earnings. The University's endowments are invested primarily with the C o m m o n Fund of Westport, Connecticut, a nonprofit investment management firm specializing in the investment of more than 1,300 college and university funds totaling more than $20 billion. The University's current endowment investment program has attained annualized earnings (after fees) of 14.5 percent since its inception on January 1,1996. During the last two fiscal years, the total earnings have been more than 17 percent. USU initiated a spending policy effective July 1,1997, for all endowed funds participating in the endowment pool. The policy states that five percent of the average market value will be distributed annually to meet the purpose of the endowment. The average is determined by taking the market value at the end of each of the past three fiscal years and calculating the average value. Hidden Wealth (The following article is a reprint from the 1997 fall edition of The American Benefactor magazine.) "Marina Rose, 65, had never been rich; she spent her career as the head of the small local library in a suburban town. Just as she was beginning to contemplate retiring, her library fell into financial trouble. She fantasized about making a gift that would outlast her tenure and perhaps even her lifetime, but she had just enough retirement money saved to get by, a small house with a mortgage, and few other assets. She did not anticipate having much of an estate to pass on when she j died. "Most people in Rose's situation would probably conclude that there's nothing to be done. But many could be sitting on their solution: In Rose's case, a $25,000 life insurance policy that she had purchased many years before. Since she had no children, she had designated her sister as the beneficiary. The $25,000 wouldn't make a tremendous difference to her financially secure sister, but it would help give the library a new lease on life. "The first step would be to submit a change of ownership form to the insurance company naming the library as both owner and beneficiary of the policy. Next, to calculate her deduction, Rose should add up all the premiums she had paid up until the moment of the gift, to see h o w that figure compares to something called the 'interpolated terminal reserve' (slightly more than the policy's cash value.) She is entitled to deduct the lesser of the two. If premiums are still due on the policy, the payments will continue to be tax-deductible. "The library would have the option to cash in the policy right away, or it could choose to hold it until Rose's death. Usually, the charity and the donor decide together which of these paths to follow."

FLEISCHMANN COLLEGE 'OF' AG1UCULTUtu: • UN1VERSITY OF NEVADA ...BEEF CATTLE IMPROVEMENT w. C. BehLe~s Sept. 1962 Improvement in livestock production will come through research and the efforts of the purebred breeder, producer, feeder, packer and retailer all working together. This will be true whether this improvement comes from management, nutrition, breeding, or in carcass improvement through the combined influence of all of these factors. Performance traits of economic importance will benefit the producer as they improve production and reduce cost. At the same time the consumer will benefit from im­proved uniform meat products. Apparently the consumer desires tenderness, flavor, juiciness and leanness of meat coupled with economy and nutritive value, Tenderness is a most important palatability attribute for the ac­ceptance of beef. Methods of cooking, high temperature aging and enzyme treatments are ways of increasing the demand for less tender cuts of meat and lower grading carcasses. Factors such as the conformation, maturity. finish. marbling and muscle structure of meat have shown variability in tenderness. Flavor is the attribute that contributes most to a consumer's satisfaction. The intensity of flavor becomes more pronounced as animals mature. The meaty flavor and aroma of beef is associ­ated with lean tissues and recent research work suggests that the fat portions of meat may be responsible for the characteristic flavor differences; for example, between lamb and beef and even pork. Juiciness adds to the acceptability of meat. Marbling and other fat portions contribute more to juiciness than tenderness of meat. Leanness of meat in supermarket packaeing has shown great im­portance to the consumer when a choice was given between cuts differing widely in fatness. Ribeye area has only a limited value for estimating leanness in the entire carcass. (Summarized from proceedings of North Central Region Livestock Specialist Conf.) May, 1961, pgs. 13-17). Management Factors Influencing Selection: (1) Concentrate feeding of Heifer Replacements: Experimental re­sults indicate that a high level of concentrate feeding of heifers during their first winter may actually interfere with future productivity - fertility and mothering ability. These results also indicate that such treatment may reduce the magnitude of differences in mothering ability. (1) Livestock Research &Marketing Advisory Comm. Preliminary Summary, Feb., 1961, pgs. 1-5. -1- Creep Feeding Calves: There is the possibility that creep feeding may increase the accuracy of measurement of the calfls own ability for growthj however. the accuracy of measurement of differences in mothering ability may be reduced. Early Measurement of Mothering Ability: Several experiment stations have reported that calf gains to four months of age may measure mothering ability of the cow almost as well as data taken at 7-8 months of age. Performance tested cattle produce bulls that consistently sire calves with increased growth rate as compared to bulls with no selection pressure based on performance or progeny testing data. -2- Sept. 1962 UNCONTROLLED RANGE FIRES ARE A ~ffiNACE by H. M. Kilpatrick Range and Pasture Specialist Sep. 1962 The production of grass, weeds and brush during the past growing season has been the best on Nevada ranges for some time. This has occurred primari­ly because of the excellent fall and winter precipitation received over most of the state. Ground moisture was sufficient for the plants until mid-May when additional precipitation fell to extend the growing season. A large percentage of the shrubs are not too palatable for livestock during the summer, so most of this growth still remains. Livestock numbers are comparatively low so much of the grass growth is still present in a dry, cured condition. If general fall storms do not develop within the next month, Nevada's ranges will be hazardous for uncontrolled range fires. Statistics from the U. S. Forest Service show that many fires are caused by man. The hunting season will soon be opened in nearly every county. Unless moisture is re­ceived to thoroughly wet the grass and shrubs, the fire danger will remain extremely high, and will not be lowered appreciably until anow blankets the range. Uncontrolled fire is a gre8t contributor to cheatgrass invasion. Ex­amples can be observed in the Winnemucca area, on the Santa Rosa Mountains west of Paradise Valley and on ranges between Battle Mountain and Elko. In each of these areas uncontrolled fire has eliminated brUSh, weeds and native grasses and have left the soil's surface exposed to erosion. Soil is the basic resource upon which range productivity depends. Soils damaged by fires, or lost through subsequent erosion, reduces range productivity for a long time. Wind is the primary force which removes the surface soil and leaves poorer sub-soil for annual plant growth to repeat the stages of plant succes­sion. Sometimes these first annuals are unpalatable mustards, but more fre­quently cheatgrass covers the surface. These successional stages are nec­essary because range administrators have not in the past made adequate pre­parations to secure perennial grass seed and airplanes to reseed the burns immediately after the ashes cool. We should give tribute to the U. S. Forest Service in western Nevada for the efforts they made to seed thousands of acres of range after the fire, north and east of Donner several years ago, removed trees and ground cover. There, annual rye and perennial grass seed were broadcast by airplanes as soon as the ashes cooled. This action results in a plant cover which re­duced the hazard of erosion, sedimentation in the rivers and flood. A research study at Dubois, Idaho on "Comv~rison of Four Different Meth­ods of Selective Sagebrush Control" showed that controlled burning even done at the proper season and under good conditions was the only treatment that injured any grasses. The other treatments were rotobeatings, spraying with 2,4 D, and railing. -3- Joseph Pechanec and George Stewart, co-authors of USDA Farmerts Bulle­tin No. 1948, entitled "Sagebrush Burning ... Good and Bad", state that accidental or haphazard burning nearly always ~roduces damages or loss, often of disastrous proportions. Uncontrolled fire often sweeps across wide areas and destroys property. The burned areas are often so extensive that it is impossible to protect it properly from too early grazing or recurrent fires." Uncontrolled fire is a hazard to stockmen who cannot make the necessary adjustments to manage graZing p~~perly after the burn, or who do not have enough livestock to adequately graze the cheatgrass while it is green and succulent. A sagebrush range which has lost the perennial grass to cheatgrass is immediately reclassified from type number 4 to 18. In my opinion, cheatgrass range types should be fenced to secure greater control of grazing during the period of utilization. Research reported by the Intermountain Forest and Range Experimental Station, U. S. Forest Service, Ogden, Utah, has shown that yearling steers and heifers made an average daily gain of 2.09 pounds from May 15 to June 23 on cheatgrass ranges. This gain was made despite the fact that the cheatgrass matured during this period. It is the opinion of many range technicians that the most economical method of converting a cheatgrass range to a perennial range 15 by plowing and reseeding perennial species. To do this also requires the area to be fenced. Fire hazards are intensified by under-utilization of cheatgrass. An annual such as this, relished by livestock while green, I believe, is not properly utilized until 75 percent of the annual growth has been removed. This degree of utilization likewise requires fencing cheatgrass range types. -4- HERITABILITY OF BEEF CATTLE CHARACTERISTICS D. W. Cassard Sept. J 1962 In selective breeding programs for the iIDprovement of beef cattle, there are many different characteristics of the cattle to which the breeder can give emphasis. The more characteristics he uses, the less progress he can make in any particular one of them. Thus. it is important to emphasize as few as possible and to pick the most important ones. The only way we have of predicting how rapidly we may make progress in improving any characteristic is by' the estimates we have of its heritability. Heritability is a rating system used by geneticists. It varies between 0 (means that none of the ob­served differences will be passed on offspring) to 100 (meaning that all variation selected for would be passed on). Whether this rating is high or low for a given trait. depends on several things such as the type of mating system being used) the amount of previous selection for the characteristic, but mostly on how accurately we are able to measure it. Because of these several sources of variation, estimates of the heritability of beef cattle traits vary. The following table contains a compilation of estimates from different sources, Bnd may be used by a breeder as a guide in deciding what characteristics to give most emphasis.

Entre dichos temas se encuentra el presente proyecto de investigaci6n investigación que tiene como finalidad el desarrollo de una tecnologia tecnología simple y barata para para la producci6n producción de concentrados de tomate y la elaboraci6n elaboración de un proyecto de Viabilidad Industrial para una pequena pequeña planta procesadora de concentrados en la zona de Omereque (Prov Prov (. Campero del Dpto . de Cochabamba) Cochabamba) , siendo esta ésta una de las mas importantes areas áreas de producci6n producción de tomate con que cuenta el departamento . Los problemas de los productores de tomate en la zona de Omereque, y las prindpales principales razones por las cuales con frecuenda frecuencia rehusan agrandar las siembras , son los inadecuados sistemas de comercializacion comercialización , las amplias fluctuadones fluctuaciones estadonales estacionales en el abastedmiento abastecimiento y el precio ., el bajo rendimiento , y las perdidas pérdidas de postcosecha . Debido a que el sistema de comercializacion comercialización y de distribud6n distribución es todavia todavía rudimentario, los pequeftos pequeños agricultores se encuentran con frecuenda frecuencia a merced de los intermediaries intermediarios , quienes imponen los precios . Los agricultores que llevan sus tomates al mercado y necesitan venderfos venderlos con urgenda urgencia , pueden verse obligados a vender su producto con perdida pérdida , para no tener que volver con 61 él a su casa . Esta situadon situación podria podría mejorarse a traves través de la estabilizad6n estabilización de predos precios originada por la canalizadon canalización. de parte de la producci6n producción de tomates a la industria , mejorando de esta forma la base econ6mica económica de la regi6n región y repercutiendo no solamente en el aumento de la producci6n producción agricola agrícola sino en la disminucion disminución de los indices de migrad6n migración del campo a la dudad ciudad , ademas además de la disminucion disminución sustandal sustancial de perdidas pérdidas de tomate fresco que seran serán destinados a la industria , especialmente los frutos pequenos pequeños , deformes , etc. , que actualmente son descartados ya que su comercializadon comercialización a nivel de fruta fresca se hace muy dificil . Por otro lado ., el manejo inapropiado de los tomates despues después de la cosecha baja la calidad y generalmente causa perdidas pérdidas que oscilan entre el 15 y 20%. Este desperdicio , acompanado acompañado de precios impredecibles , acentua acentúa la variabilidad del ingreso del agricultor , lo que lo desalienta a dedicarse a la siembra de esta jmportante importante hortaliza . Los rendimientos bajos aumentan el riesgo en la producci6n producción y los agricultores vadlaran vacilarán para sembrar areas áreas mayores a menos que la industria se enfoque hacia e(eel(Incentive Incentivo de rendimientos mas más altos y mas más confiables . Las fluctuadones fluctuaciones estacionales de los precios , hacen que estos éstos se eleven cuando el suministro de tomates es escaso , y desciendan bruscamente cuando es abundante . Por este motive motivo una alternativa de soludon solución a este problema , es la industrializadon industrialización del dei tomate a traves través de una tecnologia tecnología apropjada apropiada a las condiciones de nuestro medio, vale dear decir: volumenes volúmenes de materia financiera etc la cual pequenos pequeños producci6n producción , prima , capaddad capacidad , . , con se lograra logrará incentivar la ampliad6n ampliación de los volumenes volúmenes de producci6n producción y comerclaljzaci6n comercialización del tomate.

PUBLIC SERVICE The University of Nevada presents herewith a statement of the service which is rendered to the State by the so-called public-service depart­ments of the University. - It must be understood that in order to make the work of these departments effective there is a necessity of coopera­tion between the University and the citizens of the State. \Ve hope the directions which each department gives as to the prep­r'tration of specimens to be examined will be read carefully. _ The clearer , -'- and more definitely your inquiries directed to these departments are stated the more satisfactory will be the answers. This service is given by the State free of charge to the individual citi­zens. This is made possible because of the receipt on the part of the University of national funds, and in some instances of state funds, which are to be used in the performance of these services. The president of the University would appreciate receiving from any citizen any suggestion as to how the services can be improved, or any notice of defects in the service as at present given. In order that you may receive promptly the attention of the right department, kindly address your inquiry to--'2--THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORK OF THE STATE HYGIENIC LABORATORY , :MARK F. BOYD, Bacteriologist The investigations of the last fifty years in bacteriology and preventi/"\ medicine have placed within our knowledge the methods which may be successfully used to control and eradicate the communicable diseases. Preventive medicine is based upon a knowledge of the means of trans­nlission of a given infectious disease and the methods to be used in its control. To apply this knowledge effectively necessitates the prompt diagnosis of diseases as cases occur and a careful, thorough, and continued oversight of their possible means of dissemination. It is readily apparent that measures designed to prevent the spread of a communicable disease from an existing case cannot be applied until a diagnosis of the disease I\~' is made. The earlier the diagnosis the greater will be the effectiveness of precautionary measures. In addition, the early diagnosis is a matter of great importance to a person suffering from an infectious disease, to the end that proper treatment may be given early, while the patient's vitality is in the best condition to cooperate. The diagnosis of many of these diseases can only be certainly made by laboratory examinations. The State Hygienic Laboratory of Nevada was established to make available facilities through which cases of communicable diseases could be diagnosed. From the time of its establishment until July, 1914, the laboratory made diagnoses of diphtheria, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and malaria. This service was similar to that offered by all other state lab­oratories of a similar character. Laboratory methods are not available whereby all of the known infectious diseases may be diagnosed, but we have at our disposal accurate means by which most of the widespread diseases may be recognized. In July, 1914, it was decided to make avail­able all reliable methods by which laboratory diagnoses can be made of such infectious diseases liable to appear in Nevada. Since adopting this policy the laboratory examinations have increased over 300 per cent and are continuing to increase. This step is in advance of that taken by any other state laboratory in the United States. The diseases which tl/~~ laboratory will at present undertake to diagnose make a formidable list and include anthrax, actinomycosis, cholera, dys~ntery, diphtheria, hook­worm, glanders, gonorrhea, leprosy, malaria, malta fever, lueningitis, pyogenic infections, plague, rabies, septicemia, syphilis, typhoid fever, and tuberculosis. In addition to making the diagnoses, the laboratory sup­plies containers for the collection and forwarding of material for exami­nation and supplies physicians with directions for the proper collection of material. The advances in bacteriology have shown that certain laboratory pro­ducts, known as antitoxic sera and vaccines, may be effectively used in the prevention and cure of certain of the communicable diseases. The sera or vaccines have a specific action-that is, they do not cure or pro­tect against any other conlmlmicable diseases than the one for which they were prepared. The striking effectiveness of typhoid vaccine in the--3--prevention of typhoid fever has made it one of the most useful of these preparations. This fact, together with the prevalence and losses from typhoid fever, has prompted the laboratory to prepare and distribute without charge this vaccine. The laboratory also prepares vaccines for different localized infections, such as boils, acne, urethritis, etc., from material gathered from the patient to be treated. The laboratory is ascertaining if physicians in different portions of the State can promptly obtain for use a sufficient supply of the various cura­_~ ive sera. Successful results with serum for diseases for which we have (urative sera, such as diphtheria, depends to a large extent upon the prompt administration of the serum. If the survey shows that many of these products are only obtainable with difficulty and delay, steps will be taken whereby they may be promptly obtained in any portion of the State. The bacteriologist will go to the bedside of a patient for the collection of material for laboratory examination. No fee is charged for such a call, but the traveling expenses of the bacteriologiRt to and from the bed­side must be provided. No charge is made for the laboratory examina- 7'"\ tions or for the vaccines supplied by the laboratory. As a preventive measure, the oversight of the possible means of trans­mission of the communicable diseases is as' important as the prompt diagnosis of cases. Some of the communicable diseases are only trans­missible directly from a sick to a healthy susceptible person; others, in addition to the direct method, can pursue various indirect routes in passing from a sick to a healthy person. Water and milk are the most important of the indirect routes of infection, and infection of public supplies of this character is responsible for a very' large proportion of the cases of typhoid fever and diseases of a similar character. The state laws do not permit of the sanitary supervision of public water apd milk supplies by the state health authorities. In the absence of such legal supervision, the laboratorv is endeavoring to secure the interest of muni­cipalities and corporations in the importance and necessity of such safe­guarding and will cooperate with them in the sanitary protection of such supplies. Such cooperation includes the sanitary inspection of water and milk supplies and their regular and frequent examination by laboratory methods. The sanitary inspection is made to determine the existence of possible sources of contamination, or of defects permitting of contamina­tion. The actual contamination of such supplies may be indicated by :'T:-'laboratory examinations. Since contamination is frequently of irregular , -~- occurrence, routine examinations are necessary. In the absence of efficient sanitary laws, or through inefficient admin­istration of wise laws, outbreaks of communicable diseases will appear. \Vhen such outbreaks occur, it becomes a matter of vital importance to diagnose the disease and determine the manner in which the epidemic has spread, in order that it may be promptly checked. The laboratory staff will at the request of health authorities investigate outbreaks of communicable diseases, determine their cause, and indicate methods whereby the outbreak may be checked and its repetition prevented. In a further desire to make the laboratory facilities of service to the people, various clinical laboratory examinations, such as analysis of stomach contents and urine, blood examinations, and the examination of tumors and other pathological tissues, are made free of charge, for--- 4--- physicians. This work is not permitted to interfere· with the prompt diagnosis of communicable diseases, but is undertaken as an accommo­dation. In addition to' the skilled services mentioned, the laboratory under­takes to disseminate accurate knowledge of the means of transmission of the communicable diseases and their methods of prevention. The application of the knowledge at present in our possession would be suffi­cient to eradicate most of the widely prevalent communicable diseases. However, the opportunities for this application do not arise unless an intelligent interest is aroused in the large number of unnecessary death~:' and sickness from preventable diseases. ...._....-........[j@lvdl-~ Briefly, the laboratory makes diagnosis of those communicable dis­eases for which laboratory methods are available, prepares vaccin.es, examines water and milk supplies, and investigates the outbreaks of various communicable diseases; In the Hygienic Laboratory the State has a department actively engaged in the performance of its functions in the prevention of communicable diseases, offering a service wider than that of any other State in the country. The services of the laboratory are in continuously greater demand, and the laboratory staff realizes that .-1' the opportunities for further and greater service to the State are~by no means exhausted.--5--DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND DRUGS CONTROL S. C. DINSMORE, Commissioner in Charge ~ Next to air, food is the greatest necessity of life. A study of the vari­" 1S kinds of food adapted to human existence-their relation to the needs of the human body, their influence on the health of the individual, their quality of purity, or freedom from matters foreign and injurious to health­is one of the essential studies in connection with pure-food laws and the sanitary conditions under which food products are prepared. ' The Food and Drugs Law of this State was passed by the 1909 session of the Legislature and became effective January 1, 1910. The law is modeled after the National Food and Drugs Act, and provides that all rules, regulations, definitions, and decisions, proclaimed by the Secretary "'" of Agriculture for the enforcement of the national Act shall be adopted by this State in the enforcement of our state law. It contemplates two things: the truthful branding of all articles of food and drugs, and the elimination from the market of materials deleterious of health. It does not prohibit the sale of any article of food of an inferior quality, provided nothing injurious to health is contained therein, but it does provide that the article be labeled with the true nature of its composition. As an example, lemon extract can be sold containing a less amount of lemon oil than is required by law-5 per cent by volume-but it must be labeled tt One-third Strength;' tt Half Strength;' !lImitation;' or !l Lemon Substitute;' as the case may be. If it is artificially colored, that fact must also be stated on the label. The correct labeling of an imitation satis­fies the law, and the consumer has his choice of buying that imitation or payinga little more and getting the genuine article. The whole subject of labeling can be covered with the statement: tt The label should tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth:' In our work of inspection it is noticeable that some manufacturers ingeniously contrive phraseology for evading the provisions of the Food and Drugs Law to a point that will barely enable them to escape prosecution. A few years ago it was a common occurrence to find products on the ~cal market labeled with most extravagant statements regarding their " "-purity, quality, and strength, which were false and misleading in every particular. \Vithout regulations and some supervision of food products, adulteration and substitution may be easily practised by the unscrupu­lous manufacturer. Some of the more common forms of adulteration are spices mixed with ground peanut or cocoanut shells or other materials, and in some cases, as for instance cloves, the essential oil may be extracted and the exhausted material placed on the market as ground cloves. Lemon extract may consist of a liquid substance artificially colored and containing but a trace of oil of lemon. Acetic acid diluted with water and colored with caramel may be placed on the market and sold as pure cider vinegar; olive oil adulterated with cotton-seed oil, the physical appearance of which is very similar to olive oil, but the market price much less. For butter, oleomargarin may be substituted; for honey, glucose, or a mixture of glucose. with honey. The writer has actually--- 6--- seen on the market such a honey substitute, labeled, by the way, as pure honey, put up in attractive glass containers with a dead bee in the mixture to further lead the consumer to believe the product was genuine and to make the deception more complete. Before the advent of the Food and Drugs Law it was not uncomlnon to find meat" products manu­factured locally containing the chemical preservative, sulphurous acid, or mixed with an excessive amount of some starchy material. The latter form of adulteration is practis'ed to make the product take up more water than it would under normal conditions and thus materially increa~~ the weight; and so on down the list scores of such deceptions and fraueL : might be cited. It is thus plainly seen that a State n1aintaining no food regulation is prone tobecome a dumping ground by unscrupulous manu­facturers who cannot sell their products in States where food laws 'are enforced. The food and foodstuffs of former times were few and simple as com­pared with ours. Formerly the food markets were not filled with all manner of goods prepared and ready for consumption. Formerly the food materials that were bought and sold were mainly of a raw and crude nature with none of the virtues extracted, nor mixed and packed with If' foreign materials that would materially reduce their food value. In other days, when the consumer bought his raw material direct from the producer and prepared the foods himself Or raised his own raw material, adultera­tion and substitution were unknown. As civilization became more broad­ened and inventive genius more active, prepared foods ready for consumption and the treating 6f foodstuffs to make them more pleasing to the eye became more common. 'Vith the introduction of the canning and prepared food industries, the chances for food adulteration and the ten1ptation to do so became greater. Finally the market reached such a state that legislation was absolutely necessary to curb the gross practises of the unscrupulous manufacturer.' For a great many years food laws have been enforced in certain European countries, and products which they could not sell on their own market were shipped to this country. . Several of our Eastern States have had food laws on their statutes for the last fifteen or t,,'enty years regulating in a general way food products manufactured within the' State as well as those products coming from other sections of the country. For years the attempt had been made to enact a national food law, by Congress, but it was not until 1906 that the measlire received favorable action. Since the passage of the Federal Act the different Statl~ became active and at the present time there is not a State in the Unic that does not have food and drugs laws on its statute books. The Federal law has full control and jurisdiction over food or drug products shipped in interstate commerce only. The Federal authorities do not have any jurisdiction whatever over products manufactured in a' State and sold within the boundaries of that State, such work falling upon the several state food and drug officials. That certain manufacturerswill take chances in getting' their products by the Federal inspectors is evidenced by the work of the different state departments. It is self-evident that the Federal inspectors cannot exercise supervisionovet all interstate shipments, and to that end close cooperation exists between the Federal Department of Food and' Drugs Inspection and the various state officials. Many ship­ments of food products found to be adulterated or misbranded' could not be taken up under the state law, but by working in cooperation with the Federal authorities such cases may be satisfactorily and speedily adjusted~ 7 The Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture has there­fore commissioned the State Food Official, giving him authority to gather all the evidence necessary pertaining to any interstate shipment which by inspection and analysis shows the product to be in violation of the National Food and Drugs Law. In such cases all the evidence is placed before the Federal authorities, who proceed with the prosecution under the Federal Act. As stated above all the rules and regulations announced officially for the enforcement of the Federal Act, automatically are adopted by the 7'"'tate for the enforcement of the state law. Under date of June 1 this department received a copy of the amendment made to the regulation relating to the guaranty clause· on package goods to the effect that after May 1, 1915, the legend ((Guaranteed under Food and Drugs Act June 30, 1906, Serial No. ;' must be eliminated from the label. This phrase has been misleading to many consumers, as it has tended to con­vey the impression that it was a guaranty of the purity of the product bearing the statement, and that the goods were actually guaranteed by the United States Government. On several occasions the writer has heard r-.., the consumer n1ake the expression that ((Blank's brand of so and so is all right because it is guaranteed under the Food and Drugs law;' the decla­ration being made on the label. This supposition is erroneous, however natural it may seem that the clause referred to should stand for purity, and many of the most adulterated foods on the American market carry the legend-in fact, there is no doubt but what advantage has been taken of the guaranty clause, hoping to convey the impression that inferior and adulterated products were standard .and had the approval of the United States Government. The real significance of the clause is a guaranty given by the manufacturer to the retail dealer that the article of food so labeled would meet the requirements of the state and national laws. If upon inspection and analysis the product was found to be adulterated, misbranded, or misleading. in any particular, the retail dealer could not be held responsible, but the action would fall upon the manufacturer, jobber, or other party establishing the guaranty, and interstate shipments would necessarily have to be taken up by the government officials. With the abolition of the guaranty clause and serial number which have been ordered stricken from the files by the United States Secretary of Agricul­ture, the retail dealer receiving shipments from other States for his own protection should obtain in writing a general guaranty from his jobber ~lat all products purchased will meet the requirements of the Nevada 'c '- ~ j1"ood and Drugs Law. Failing to produce such a statement duly executed by the manufacturer or jobber, he will be held liable for any adulterated food products found in his possession. Other important decisions received during the past few months relate to th~ labeling of certain food products with net-weight statements, the labeling of olive oil, meaning of the term H orangeade;' the term ((stringless;' as applied to anyone variety of beans, labeling of mineral water salts for medicinal use, and many others. The present market conditions show a great improvement in all lines of food products. The legitimate manufacturer welcomes food legisla­tion and is doing everything in his power to meet the requirements of the food laws, both state and national. l\fany national organizations have been promoted within the last few years, such as the National Can­ners .Association , the National Confectioners Association, American Feed Manufacturers Association, and other allied interests who have banded--- 8--- themselves together to further the production of high-grade quality of goods. At the last convention of the Association of State and National Dairy and Food Commissioners one day was set aside and turned over to the manufacturers for them to present their side in food and drug matters. 'Vithout exception every manufacturer represented, which included many of the largest in the United States, emphatically stated that they favored food and drugs legislation, and it 'yas their keen desire to cooperate with those intrusted with the adlninistration of the food laws of the country in every manner possible. During the"past year hundreds of samples of food products have bee~-:' examined in the laboratory. The amount of adulteration found has been small indeed, as compared with inspections of previous years. 'Ve find all products shipped into the State are labeled to comply with our weights and measures regulation, our law req"\liring that every package must be labeled in terms of net weight, measure, or numerical count. This provision of the law obviates any possibility of deceptive packages, and the consumer knows the quantity he is purchasing. At the last session of the State Legislature the Nevada food law was amended so as to provide for the sanitary inspection of places where food products are If' manufactured, stored, or offered for sale. Sanitary inspection in connection with food and drugs work is a most important field, as results obtained during the past year thoroughly indi­cate. The work started is to be continued until every place within the State has been subject to inspection and places found filthy and unsani­tary cleaned up. 'Ve have given special attention to the public dairies of the State during the past few months and find work along this line to be well warranted. Milk is one of the many important food products and too much care cannot be exercised in its production and distribution. Milk can be classed as being almost a perfect food, since it is the only single article of human consumption that will indefinitely sustain life. It is composed of twenty-five separate substances whose composition is made up of twenty different elements. Pure milk is one of the most healthful of foods for human consumption and is equally applicable for the infant and infirm, the young and the old, in the sick-room of the invalid, and on the training table of the athlete. As an article of diet, it has been known and used since the first pages of recorded history, when milk-producing animals constituted a large proportion of the wealth of the ancients. Carefully conducted experiments have demonstrated that in the process of digestion of the healthy individual more than 99.5 per~ cent of the nutritive portions of milk is assimilated. l\Iilk in Reno sells for approximately 8 cents per quart at retail. Based on the theoretical values, when milk sells for this price, Round beef should sell for 11 cents per pound Sirloin beef should sell for 13 cents per pound Mutton should sell for 16 cents per pound Pork loin should sell for c••••••••••••••••••.••••••••••.17 cents per pound Ham should sell for 19 cents per pound Bacon should sell for 4 cents per pound Oysters should sell for -:1 cents per pound When -the nutritive value of milk is better understood and the false impression that it is a high-priced article is removed, a nlllCh larger con­sumption of milk will take place. It has been our aim in taking up the work of dairy inspection to impress upon the dairymen the important fact that milk produced under strictly sanitary conditions is a great asset--- 9--- to their business, and to improve dairy conditions in every town in the State. Our work during the past year has been very beneficial, but much yet remains to be accomplished. We find the dairymen willing and anxious to cooperate with us, expressing a desire to carry out any sug­gestions offered to better their methods and equipment. The restaurants of the State have received our attention, and on this particular line of work the State has been pretty well covered . We pro­pose next to nlake sanitary inspections of all meat markets, grocery stores, bakeries, candy kitchens, and abattoirs, and publish the ratings for the '/tnformation of the public. During the past two years 1,190 official samples have been taken and examined in the laboratory. About one-third of this number was drug samples manufactured locally, and the results show a marked improve-' ment over conditions existing on previous inspections. Seventy-five hear­ings have been conducted on violations of the state law. These cases embraced adulterated milk, ice-cream below standard, shortweight but­ter, imitation products placed on the market and offered for sale pur­porting to be standard, conducting unsanitary food-manufacturing plants, r"... etc. 'Vhile convictions were not obtained in all of these cases, these hearings certainly had their effect and in every instance, I am satisfied, were fully as effective as a court conviction would have been. In carry­ing on the work in the State it has always been our aim to make it edu­cational in so far as possible. Wherever irregularities have been found, the offending parties have been notified, the matter has been taken up with them in detail, and a way pointed out whereby conditions could be . bettered. 'Vhenever the suggestions offered have not been carried out, we have not hesitated in starting action. On June 1, 1911, the State Weights and Measures Law became effec­tive. This work brought additional duties to this department, both in field and laboratory work. The inspection of scales, measuring devices, gasoline pumps, oil-tanks, etc., has been carried on together with the inspection of food and drug products, and one man has been able to carry out both inspections at the same time. This arrangement cuts off a considerable expense to the State, since it eliminates the salary of an extra inspector and his traveling and liv~ng expenses. During the past year 639 weighing devices have been examined. The number con­demned has been very few as compared with the number condemned the first year the work was inaugurated. At the present time scales t"'"'\used by the retail dealers of the State are in excellent condition, the only " • fault that we have to find being that the dealers will allow their scales to become dirty, bearings to corrode, or other parts to get out of adjust­ment, in which condition the scales will not weigh accurately. By period­ical and systematic inspection we have been enabled to correct these minor errors and keep the scales in good condition. Numerous samples of food products have been sent to the laboratory by residents of the State during the past year for analysis. We have always made it a point to give such samples our careful attention and report results as soon as possible. Every complaint filed with the department bearing on certain irregularities has been carefully investigated. The field we have to cover is great, our working force is small, and there are many points that escape our observation. \Ve welcome any information we may receive from the consumer pointing out conditions that should receive Qur attention, and stand ready at any time to do everything in our--10--power to correct them. .'Ve heartily solicit the cooperation of the peo­ple who are in position to render us great assistance in carrying out the intent and purpose of the Nevada Food and Drugs, and "\Veights and Measures Law. A text law, together with the rules and regulations adopted by the department, has been published in pamphlet form, and copies may be had upon application.--11--STATE LABORATORY OR STATE ANALYTICAL LABORATORY 'VALTER S. PALMER, Assistant Professor of Mining and Metallurgy Under an Act passed by the State Legislature on March 16, 1895, and ::7"""amended .March 16, 1897, citizens of the State of Nevada may send ores , ~nd Ininerals to the State University and have them analyzed and assayed without cost. Only citizens of Nevada have this privilege, and they may send only such material as may' be taken' from within the boundaries of the State (Sections 4660-4663, Revised Laws of Nevada). Gold and silver assays, however, by special provision of the law, must be reported in general terms; all other determinations can be reported without such restrictions. This is done so as not to interfere with the work of profes­sional assayers. The laboratory has now been maintained for almost twenty years. r".. There is a real need of some place where the prospector can secure an unbiased report concerning the nature and value of any mineral substance that he may discover. Although the work is done free, unfair advantages of the law have not been taken, except in a very few cases. No one appreciates more than the men who have had charge of the work the bona fide nature of the requests. That advantage is taken of this laboratory is shown by the fact that since the year 1903 to date, letters have been sent to 4,519 individuals. Samples have probably been received from every postoffice in the State. On 9,033 samples received during this time there have been 31,926 determinations made. The increase of this work is shown from the fact that for the year 1903­1904, 142 persons sent in 222 samples from 64 localities, on which 962 determinations were made, while for the year ending with December 15, 1914, we have received from 804 persons 1,631 samples from 248 locali­ties, and on which 6,533 determinations have been made. These figures show an increase of over 600 per cent in the amount of work now handled over that of ten years ago. The work is now increasing at the rate of about 50. per cent per year. :-"\ Two years ago it was decided to keep the laboratory open during the ;'" summer vacation in order so give the prospector the advantage of the - same during the time of the year best suited to prospecting. Before this time the sanlples were allowed to collect during the summer months and were determined as soon as college opened in the fall. Owing to the number of samples which collected, it was in some cases found impossible to send out some of the reports for a month after the opening of the laboratory. This meant that samples received from the 1st of June to the 1st of Septmnber were not all reported until about the 1st of October, and that there was a possibility of samples remaining in the laboratory as long as four months before the reports could be submitted. This long delay detracted greatly from the value of the determinations. Dur­ing the past two summers we have kept the laboratory open and have been able to aid 265 persons, who brought in 567 samples from 126 localities, and on which 2,238 determinations were made. I consider the--12--- change a valuable one and recommend that it be continued during the coming two years. The work is not without its peculiar difficulties. Few of the people who send in samples for determination realize the necessity of taking accurate samples. Some will request quantitative work on small single­piece specimens. The results on such specimens are always misleading and are rarely of any value. Again, some people will break their speci­men of ore into two pieces, sending one piece to the laboratory and the other to their assayer. It is rarely that the results secured by both~., assayers will agree, with the result that the person receiving the reports ; will lose confidence in either the laboratory or the assayer, according as they report either the presence or absence of values. Experiments which we have carried out in the laboratory under these latter conditions have resulte,d in securing results differing in value by several hundred dollars per ton. Others will send in samples without any identification marks, in which case the laboratory is accused of being unwilling to do their work. The work is entirely carried on by the three men of the teaching staff of the :Mackay School of Mines in addition to their regular work, together ~' with a student assistant who assists in the assaying. The appropriation from the State to carryon this work for the past two years was $4,100. During this time, the laboratory made 11,455 determinations on 2,742 samples received from 1,380 persons and coming from practically every town in the State.--13--SOILS LABORATORY PROFESSOR MAXWELL ADAMS, Chemist in Charge A wide diversity of opinion exists concerning the value of a chemical ,/inalysis in determining the usefulness of a soil for agricultural purposes. .' :t is quite definitely known what substances are necessary for plant growth, and the composition of a soil may be determined with equal definiteness, so that the problem of soil fertility, according to the opinion of some, appears a simple matter-merely determine the composition of the soil by chenlical analysis, and supply, through artificial means, the deficient plant-food. The problem is by no means so simple. There are many factors involved, which do not come under the observation of the analyst, that may render a chemically fertile soil worthless. There are, therefore, those who maintain that a chemical analysis is useless. r--.. Between these two extremes there is doubtless a middle ground of truth, and in Nevada, where alkali is a very potent factor in agriculture, a chemical analysis, which determines the amount and kind of soluble salts present in a given soil, will prove a very material aid in the valua­tion of land. The State of Nevada has for many years provided in the University a laboratory in which any resident of the State may submit samples of soil for analysis, free of charge. There are many questions of soil fertility upon which we do not presume to pass, but a careful analysis will often show conclusively that a soil is not suitable for agricultural purposes, and thereby save a large outlay in worthless development. The water to be used for irrigation purposes is also an important con­sideration. For example, a soil rich in lime, which is a valuable plant­food, should not be irrigated with water containing much salt, because through a double decomposition reaction l(black alkali" is formed, which after a few years may accumulate in the soil to such an extent that its fertility becomes impaired. The United States Governmens has done much work on general inves­tigations along this line, but while this work is being carried on Nevada has kept in line with other \Vestern States by providing a place in the ~tate University where the analysis of soil and water is made to meet " the requirements, in any specific case which may arise. We hope to make the department of soils more useful by a closer cooperation with the farmers of the State. Not perhaps by making a greater number of analyses, but by making them more intelligently and with a more detailed statement furnished by the collector who submits the sample. The analysis of a soil entails considerable expense on the part of the State, and it is not the intention to make these examina­tions merely to satisfy the indefinite curiosity of some one, but to supply information that will be of definite economic application. The chemical analysis of the soil and water is only a part of the work. We wish to aid more fully in the interpretation of the results by collect­ing complete information regarding the orig~n of the soil sample and the particular purpose for which the land is to be used. We hope funds .--14--will be available:whereby, after the farmer and analyst have furnished all the data at their command, a specialist may be sent to' the locality, who will be able to apply to the!solution of the problem in hand all the information collected.--15- EXTENSION WORK IN HOME ECONOMICS NORMA J. DAVIS, Field Worker ((If you can't come to the University, 7'\ The University will come to you~' The Extension Department in Home Economics for the University of Nevada has been created to assist the women and the girls of the rural districts of the State of Nevada in solving problems relative to the home. As Sarah Louise Arnold has said, It I-Iome is a growing-place, by means of which ,ye become prepared to share in the great business of life, carry­ing our load and contributing our strength:' The things that endure in these homes of ours are the things that pass into us and become a part of us; the things that are vital in our development. All of us cannot r-.... attend the University to receive knowledge which will help us make our homes growing-places, of greater value to ourselves and to our children. However, we are all striving ttto make the best better:' And the Exten­sion Department in Home Economics believes that it may be of assis­tance in making the best better and in passing good suggestions on to all the women and girls of the State. In one sense, it may become a women's exchange where practical and valuable knowledge is collected from the women of the State and in turn passed back to women of the State who seek it. Thus its nl0tto will be It If you have a good thing, pass it on:' The department, in order to do this, has planned to organize home economics clubs in districts where the women and the girls would like to cooperate with the University. Members of these clubs will take up a study of problems of the home under the topics of food, clothing, shelter, and household management. Each member will receive a lesson and return a written report on the previous lesson to the extension depart­ment every nlonth. All lessons are to be carefully followed out at home by actually doing the things directed. In the girls' clubs, competitive cooking contests will be arranged for, so that the girls will strive to train their heads to think, plan, and reason, and their hands to be useful, helpful, and skilful. ~ Lectures and demonstrations under these topics will also be given on request from the ladies of any community, club, or any other organiza­tion in the State of Nevada. Under the topic of tt Food" subjects may be discussed as follows: 1. The Principles of Cooking Different Classes of Food. 2. The Power of Diet and Good Cooking, or the Factors Involved in Planning a Meal. 3. "\Vhat Food Contains, or the Composition and Classification of Food. 4. The Economics of Food. 5. The Canning of Fruits and Vegetables, or Preserving (including study of relation of yeasts, molds, etc., to fermentation and other food changes).--16--6. The Serving of Food (including a study of customs of times and races; relation of form and color to service; the harmony of materials, furnishings, color, and design for decorating the table) . 7. Feeding of Children. 8. Labor-saving Devices for the Home. Under the topic of H Clothing" subjects may be discussed as follows; 1. Simple Tests for Identification of the :l\faterials in Fabrics. 2. The Production and :l\fanufacture of Different Fibers for Fabrics~. 3. The Removal of Stains from Different Fabrics. 4. The Factors Involved in Choice ofa Costume and of a Garment. Under the topic of n Shelter" subjects may be discussed as follows: 1. Standards in Choice of a Home, Site, Purpose, etc. 2. Factors to be Considered in Planning the House. 3. Home Decoration. Under the topic of IIHousehold Management" subjects may be dis-cussed as follows: ~ 1. Aims and Results of Household Management. 2. The Value of Budget Making and Account Keeping to the House­keeper. 3. Working Plans Based on Division of Income. The Extension Department in Home Economics of the University of Nevada seeks the cooperation of the parents, teachers, and all the women interested in these subjects which are so vitally related to the physical, mental, and moral well-being of every person in the State. It hopes to give knowledge which may help to make every home in the State of Nevada a better growing-place. ~.;  .

Information Commoner: Keeping Library Staff on Common Ground, 2012 April; Information Commoner April 2012 Volume 6, Issue 6 Keeping Library Staff on Common Ground In This Issue Announcements 2 Department News 2 Employee Spotlight 7 What’s Our Policy? Mike’s Message This is the story of Mike who liked to play tennis. He could serve like Pete Sampras, return like Andre Agassiz, run like Rafael Nadal, and hit forehands like Roger Federer. One day, young Mike was playing tennis and the next day his back began to hurt. Mike could not sit in the car without lying down and rolling on his side. An MRI revealed that Mike had a degenerative disc with pinching vertebrae that put sciatic pain down his left leg and foot. So Mike did physical therapy for two months, and then tried to schedule an appointment with a surgeon. Two months later surgery was scheduled in a month with Mike being off sick for the next three weeks. Since then, Mike came to work part-time working only part days. Mike took off quite a bit of sick time in the nine months between August and April. Fortunately, Mike had saved many hours of sick time over the years, so he was able to collect his salary. Today, Mike has six days left from forty-one in August with more time to take. Don’t wake up in a roadside ditch. Don’t sell your hair to a wig dealer. Save your sick time and collect your check. By Lesli Baker The campus recently began using new donation forms for both small and large gifts. Patrons who wish to donate books valued under $5,000 will need to submit the new form. The Library will no longer have a separate form to complete. For donations over $5,000, please refer the donor to Mike. Our gifts policy and donation forms are available from our web site at www.uvu.edu/library/policies/gifts.html. 2 INFORMATION COMMONER Announcements Semester Break Hours The Library will be on limited hours during the semester break: April 27—May 3 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM Closed Saturday May 4 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM May 5 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM Normal hours resume May 7. EDITORIAL INFORMATION The Information Commoner is an internal communication tool published once a month by and for the Utah Valley University Library staff. Input from all library staff is encouraged. The deadline for information submittal is the third Friday of each month. Send information to Lesli via email. News from Technical Services By Keith Rowley Busy is the ever present word for things in Technical Services. Christina is busy receiving a large bunch of videos which have recently arrived, including over 50 opera DVDs requested by the Music Department. (If you would like some advice on which to view first, I’d be glad to be of assistance.) Linda is busy processing music CDs and donated videos. The librarians have supplied Shuyi with a large stack of orders to enter. Jennie is busy cataloging the last of the Theatre Department donation, and then she’ll be working on books for Constitutional Studies. Paul has a wide variety of books, music scores, videos and CDs to catalog. For the last three months Paul has also been busy instructing our cataloging intern whose last day with us was April 10. Erin Mumford was a quick learner and was at the end able to catalog everything Paul presented to her. She was able to transfer that instruction into a Cataloging Procedures manual for us. She is applying for jobs in the Las Vegas area. We wish her well.

Bindery Shipment Update We currently have one shipment at the Bindery and will be sending another as soon as the previous one is received within the next couple of weeks. We will not be sending another shipment to the bindery until the end of the fiscal year, so if there are any items from the collections that need rebinding, please alert me so that I can add them to the latest outgoing shipment. News from Serials Standardized Sign-on Objective for All Library Applications By Mark Stevens We are currently investigating a standardization for all (or most) of our library applications to make them authenticate from the Central Cam-pus LDAP system. To illustrate, we would like to have the “MY ACCOUNT” feature in Symphony to sign-on using the patron standard UVid and password (just like logging into UVLink). Once we get this (hopefully) working in Symphony, we will try to accomplish the same thing for Interli-brary Loan (ILLIAD). That would relieve Ross Green of the trouble of dealing with patrons that forget their account names/passwords and saves the patrons from having to remember different ways to log into each system. News from Systems News from Reference/Instruction By Annie Smith I say this every year, but our database statistics just continue to show phenomenal growth. Last year was our biggest year yet when it comes to database usage. Our databases saw more than 3,400,000 searches in 2011. That’s a lot, but it looks even more impressive when you see it like this: The first few years are incomplete, but the data is reliable as far back as 2008. This upward trend seems to show no signs of slowing down. With that many searches, it means that our students, faculty, and staff were running a search every six and a half minutes every day for the entire year. I’m sure we saw many of those searches at the desk last year. In 2011, librarians answered 11,369 questions in person, by chat, by phone, by text, and by email. It also includes searches we answered while we were roving the stacks, helping students in the trenches. With the potential arrival of a discovery layer—a tool that allows searching across databases and the catalog—next fiscal year, this searching landscape will change. An in-house committee made up of librarians has been evaluating two different versions of discovery layer over the course of the semester to see if we can find one that’s the right fit for us. The committee’s work is winding down, but they still have a few hoops to jump through. They hope to announce a decision before the end of the fiscal year. 4 INFORMATION COMMONER News from Media By Kim Rollins Christy will be back before the next newsletter, on May 14! I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time in her stead, and have appreciated the opportunity to do collection development, instruction, reference and everything else that Christy does so very well here in the Library. Heather is almost through with her big DVD cleaning project, and we have also been wrestling with some media-related issues in the strategic planning process, which I'm sure Christy can shed some more light on when she returns. Faculty media requests keep coming, and we are in the process of making more room for music scores. INFORMATION COMMONER 5 News from Access Services By Jacques d’Emal We have added the very capable Chelsie Young to our team. Chelsie will cover our weeknight closing shift working 7:00 PM – midnight. If you need to speak with Chelsie in person, and don’t want to stay late, she comes in on Wednesday afternoons to attend our regular department meetings. Accompanying Chelsie at our meetings is her daughter Daphne, who does more to keep the meeting well behaved than I ever could. After working for us full-time for nearly four years, Holley Larsen left us to take a position at the Weber County Library. Congratulations to Holley. As I write this, we are close to hiring a person to fill the vacated position. By the time you read this, the person may have already started. Over Spring Break, the Circulation staff held a planning retreat to begin redesigning our process for training our student aides. Every fall we hire 15 to 20 new students, some who have never had a job before. And every fall we struggle to get these enthusiastic young people prepared, usually in less than two weeks, to face the tsunami that is the first few weeks of fall semester. Every year we feel like we did not do enough to prepare our now shell-shocked students. So this year we have decided to throw out everything we have done in the past and start over with an entirely new training program. This summer we will roll out an added service to our textbooks reserves. Currently, all textbooks are circulated on a first come, first served basis. This leads to some frustration. Quite often a student will ask to check out a textbook only to find it is already out. The student is faced with waiting near the desk watching for the text to return or returning later and hoping it is back. It is not at all unusual for a student to check back at the desk every ten to 15 minutes to see if the book is back for over an hour only to have the book returned and immediately checked out to another student. To alleviate some of this, we have given the Circ staff the ability to place a hold on a checked out reserve item for a student willing to stay nearby. When the item is returned we will notify the student by use of a restaurant pager. Tony tested the pager and discovered that they have a phenomenal range; he was able to get a signal as far away as the Woodbury building. We’ll be piloting the system over the summer and should have all the bugs worked out by fall. The pager lights up, vibrates, and buzzes when the textbook is back. 6 INFORMATION COMMONER News from the Sutherland Archives By Catherine McIntyre The Sutherland Archives and Dr. Kathryn French hosted a successful reception and exhibit for the opening of the Oral History of Utah Peace Activists. A large number of participants in the project attended the luncheon and participated in the panel discussions held afterwards in the Library Lecure Hall. Further, there was a full house in the Sutherland Archives to see the exhibit of activism photographs by Alexis Kelner. We put in lots of hours and extra work to make it a success. I especially want to thank Brent for all his hard work in printing, framing, and hanging the photographs, and for completing the Peace Activist web site before the event. I also want to thank Mike Freeman for all the support he’s given to the project and to the opening events. On April 11, the Sutherland Archives opened an exhibit from UVU Deaf Studies. The exhibit consists of many types of assistive devices for the deaf, including a number of older models of teletype machines. One of the machines, invented in the 1920s, was originally used on a Navy boat to transmit messages, but was discovered that it could be used to communicate for the deaf as well. The Deaf Studies exhibit will run through April 20, and is being held in conjunction with the Fifth Biennial Deaf Studies Today! Conference, “Beyond Talk,” being held here at UVU April 12, 13 and 14, 2012. On June 8 at 7:00 PM in the Library Lecture Hall, the Sutherland Archives will host a program derived from another oral history project we’ve been working on, called "Tabernacle Experiences and Meanings in South Central Utah: An Oral History." Dr. Simon Fass and Ronald Smith of the University of Texas-Dallas will present the program. They were funded by grants from the Utah Humanities Council and Utah State History to conduct oral histories with residents of central Utah towns with Mormon tabernacles. These towns include Manti, American Fork, Spring City, Vernal, and Provo. The people interviewed are mostly long-time residents of these towns, and they talk about how important the tabernacle has been to their town—architecturally, culturally, historically, and spiritually. We did the transcribing for the project, as well as local photography, and will eventually get copies of each interview for our own archives. Opening night at the Peace Activists’ Exhibit A TTY (teletypewriter) machine Chelsie Young recently joined the UVU Library as its newest circulation supervisor. Background information I am originally from the sprawling metropolis of Orangeville, Utah. Population 1,398. I moved here from Logan with my husband, Trevor, and our adorable daughter Daphne (almost five). I apologize in advance that you all aren’t her parents. We have no pets as I do not like animals. This saddens the rest of my family. Too bad for them. Favorite things about job/UVU I love libraries! I came here from the Orem Public Library and before that I worked in various department at the Utah State University Libraries (circulation, acquisitions, ILL). So my favorite part is that I’m at a library. Also, the people here are fabulous. Education/where did you go to school? I earned a bachelor of science degree from USU doubling in History and Law and Constitutional Studies. Favorite things to do in your spare time or hobbies I love crafting (especially crochet), cooking, spending time with family, and consuming all sorts of media. Any other fun stuff or interesting things about you that you’re willing to share? I love bacon and cheese. Sometimes I even eat them together.

Brown,C_OH5_001; Abstract: This is an oral history of Connie Brown. It was conducted March 1, 2007 and concerns her recollections of the history of the Marriott-Slaterville area. CB: My name—I was christened Clonda Elizabeth Stanger. I changed that. I have a nickname now and I am called Connie all the time to everybody. I was born in a red brick house down here on the corner just a block away from where I am right now. It is 1900 West 700 South. My parents were Archie Stanger and Beatrice Home Stanger. Dad was born here just up the street just east of here half a mile and I think he lived in Marriott all his life too. My mother came from Wilson Lane—over south. Her mother had a great pioneer story. We were all just common, ordinary people. We were poor and we didn’t know we were poor. I never knew what poor meant because I was so rich with love and fun and blessings. We had plenty of food. We raised our own lovely, big gardens and our big farm. We had all the tomatoes and green peas and corn and everything we could possibly eat. Yes, I knew how to farm. I got an awful sore back because I think of all the potatoes I lifted—and sugar beets. But I did it. I really loved to farm. I wouldn’t trade my younger years for anything. We went out on the farm I imagine when we were six, seven, eight years old and worked all day. On the farm, I’ll tell you, I learned to work. I am proud of the fact that I know how to work and appreciate work. We would get up in the morning fairly early. Mom would always have breakfast for us and we would don on some old overalls that my brothers had thrown away and old shoes that my brothers had discarded. The shoes always had big holes in the sole and in the bottom of my feet now I have a callus about this big around from where the holes were. We would take a piece of cardboard in our overall pocket and we would keep putting a new inner-sole in our shoe to keep that hot, sunny, hard dirt from hurting us. But we didn’t mind that. That was fun. We worked right along as a family. Dad worked right with us and mother some of the times worked with us but she had a lot of housework to do. Early in the spring we would have to stay out of school sometimes a little bit to thin the sugar beets. That was fun. My dad would take a long handled hoe and go along in front of me and my sister Sally and he would chop the beets so there would just be a little handful of about six little plants left and we had to pull all of them out but one so that one would grow into a big beet. All summer long they needed to be hoed to get the weeds out so they would mature and then in the fall—about in November—we would have to top the sugar beets. Boy, they were so big I would have to set one on my knee. It’s a wonder I didn’t cut my leg off with that big beet on it. It was hard, hard work for the sugar beets. Dad would plow the beets up out of the ground and then me and all my brothers and sisters—we’d come along the row and the knife had a little hook on it. It was just a great big butcher knife and it had a little hook on it and you would snag that sugar beet and you’d lift it up and—the boys, they could hold it in their hand and whop it usually, but I would have to lay mine on my knee and chop the top off and then we would throw them in a big pile. The boys, later, would come along and throw them up into the big dump trucks and they would take them over to Wilson Lane to the sugar factory to be processed. One year, I stayed out of school the whole first six weeks of school to help with the harvest. I am sure that is because dad didn’t have any money to pay for help. That is the only “D” I ever got in school. The first six weeks when the report card came it just had written on it “not sufficient attendance” and that about broke my heart. But then we had potatoes and there was a big machine and it had a little rotator wheel on it. We had already cut the potatoes in little pieces of potato—maybe six or eight little pieces and each little piece had an eye in it. You know how the eyes on potatoes are? We had to make sure that there was an eye on each one of those little pieces of potato and then dad would leave them to kind of dry for about a week. He called it “healing.” Then we would put the sack up in a place on the potato planter and the machinery would just bring it down. We would have to make sure there was one set—one little piece of potato in each of these little gadget things on this wheel. The machinery would take them down in the soil and cover them up and then we would pull them about twice a year. In the fall, dad always had his two brothers and all us kids to do the potatoes. He would go along and plow them up and there was a big machine called the sorter. It would go along and it had two or three levels of wire and the little holes in the first wire would let all the rocks and the little tiny nubby potatoes go through and they would go back on the ground and then the bigger potatoes on top of that. They’d all fall out onto the ground and us kids would have to pick them up. We would have old buckets and anything we could have—just buckets. I can remember lifting those buckets and putting these potatoes up on the sorter to go through and my back would nearly break. My uncles would say, “Connie, let me lift that for you.” And I was so stubborn I thought, “Well, I am going to show them I can do it myself.” And I did. I lifted all those potato buckets up myself. So now today I have a back to pay for that. And tomatoes they were fun. Oh gosh, dad would—we had a tomato planter too—and it would put a little bit of water in a hole and we would see that the tomato plant got in there and put the dirt up around those tomato plants. As they would grow we would have to go through the field and make sure that all of them took root and grew or else we just had to hand transplant some tomatoes. It was so fun when they got big and we would—not sneak, but we would go up and down those rows looking for a little red tomato down in those vines. That was really neat. Then, of course, picking them—we had a big flat box—I guess it weighed about seventy-five pounds of tomatoes and we would just lift that along. Us girls—any of us would just have to lift those boxes along and fill it full of tomatoes. Then the trucks would come along and gather it up. The green peas—the boys did all that because they would have to get up real early in the morning. Dad wanted to cut the peas while there was some dew on them—while they were crisp and nice. He would get up and mow them down with a mowing machine. Then the boys and dad would load them on a big hay rack. The pea viner is just down on this next corner west. All the farmers would bring their pea trucks full of peas down past my dad’s house here. By nine o’clock all of us kids were out there pulling peas off the wagon and we would run along by the side of the road and eat the peas. They would process them down at the pea viner. When I got a little bit older, beans—some of the farmers—Ed Dayne was the first one I think that contracted with—I guess it was Del Monty, and he raised just acres and acres and acres of green beans. Later, my dad also did because he had grown down at “the lane,” we called it here, to the dead end. That whole area down there was just full of beans. That is the first paying job us kids had. We earned a penny a pound. We thought that was so neat but I loved to pick the green beans and the yellow beans. You just crawl along between two rows and snatch them off in handfuls. It was really and truly fun. All those city dudes—they came out here on the country farms to earn money and it was funny. Here us kids were with our old overalls and straw hats and all these city dudes had these “panama hats” they called them—they were all colored, pretty hats and nice overalls and shirts. We could work harder than they did. All the neighboring towns—it was just a big mass production thing. It was great. That way I was able to earn all my school clothes and whatever I needed money for. I remember one year working out in the red beet field down there and I picked up a big crate that had a big wire on it and I have still got the scar on my finger. It was more than an inch like a “Y.” That thing bled—so the boss of the field just took me in and tore off his shirt tail and if I remember correctly he dipped that in the gas can and wrapped my finger up. I got to sit under the tree for about a half an hour to recuperate. Then I was back in the field working again but no doctors, no nothing like that. I never did have to go to the doctor for all the scrapes. Maybe that is enough of the farm work. When we would come home from the farm at noon, our transportation was horse and wagon. We’d all load on the wagon and go over to the field. Part of our field that dad rented was over in the top part of Slaterville over by the Meyerhoffer’s. Mostly over there we raised sugar beets, that is what I remember over there most. But I liked to work over there because there were a few little swampy areas that had bullrushes and they would have the prettiest wild flowers and birds in there. I just loved every time dad would let us rest for awhile. I didn’t rest, I would hurry over and watch the birds and things like that. There was about three apple trees along the end of the field and we would always go down there and see if there was an apple or so that we could eat. That was fun. When we would work we would come home at noon and sometimes we would ride on the back of the horse and other times we would just jump in the wagon and ride home. Mother was home and we’d get there and she would have dinner all ready except us girls would set the table, that is about all that was left for us to do, just help put the vittles on the table. The times that we did help get dinner ready we would mostly just peel the potatoes and carrots and shuck the corn and that sort of thing. Mother did most of the cooking herself. She always had a pie or cake for dessert, always. We had the best dinners, always good dinners. We all had our chores to do in the house. I had one of the boy’s bedrooms to clean and my other sisters had different things to do. My main job, too, was to make sure that there was wood in the box by the coal stove and a bucket of coal ready for morning. We knew enough to do that before we played. After we would get through with supper then we could go out and play ball. The neighborhood kids, you know, we’d get together and play “Run Sheepy Run” and all those old fashioned games. We had just a lot of fun doing that. After my grandfather died—my grandma was, I guess, afraid to stay alone and it became my job to go up and stay with her at night. I would always stop at Slater’s house and the whole bunch of us would get together and play “Run Sheepy Run” and all those kinds of games. By the time I got to grandmas it was about dark but she never got after me. Oh dear, but then on wash day—that was a real big thing. We just had the wringer washer and then we would have a big tub of water sitting on a bench and us kids mostly would—as the clothes would come through the wringer, we would help rinse them in this tub of water. We didn’t really do much with the washing but the boys’ dirty socks, we had to sort them out and everything before mom would wash those. Then we would help hang them out on the fence line, the stockings. Mother would hang them on the lines. We didn’t do that. In order to have hot water to do our washing and we had a certain day that we washed—always kind of a routine, at the side of our old coal stove was a reservoir. We didn’t have hot water tanks. We would have kettles on top of the stove to get the water hot and then this reservoir. We would carry that and put it in the washing machine—it was just like a great big tub, a big brown tub, and it was electric. Mother made her own soap; I never did help with that very much. You made it out of lye and different things. We would get the washing going and when it would run for twenty minutes or so mom would shut it off and then she would run the clothes through the wringer. A wringer was just kind of like—I don’t know, lots of machinery has wringers, but it would be two double rollers and it would just squish the water out of the clothes and then there was a great big tub sitting there and we would rinse them out. Sometimes we had to rinse them twice. Then mother would hang them out, I wasn’t tall enough to help lift it up onto the clothes lines. I forgot to tell you about thrashing machines. Oh, that was a day we looked forward to every year. Dad raised quite a bit of grain and Clem Eakins had the thrashing machine. It was a great big, loud, noisy old thing and he would come into the farm and he always had about twelve men helping him. I don’t quite know how to explain how that works but anyway, it would separate the grain from the stalk and then it would blow all of the straw up into a great big pile and the grain would be shifted down into gunny sacks and they would tie them up and then go dump it into the grainery. At about noon they would stop their big machinery and mother would have dinner ready for twelve big men. We would always have a few tubs of water out under the clothes lines so they would wash up for dinner and about four or five towels hanging over the clothes lines. That was a dirty job. They would all wash up and then come into mom’s kitchen and she would have a feast like a thanksgiving dinner always for them. Pies and cakes and just everything you can imagine. They ate like real working men and they loved mother’s cooking. When they were all done then us girls and mom could have our dinner, then we would do the dishes and clean up after that mess. When they were through with my dad’s grain then they would go to the next farm and do their grain and they would just go on around the neighborhood doing that. On the fourth of July we would go over to Slaterville sometimes and they would have a—I don’t know if it was the fourth of July or the twenty-fourth—sometime in July, anyway there was always a big to do down in Slaterville. We would just go there and celebrate with them. They would have foot races and ball games and all that stuff that goes on in the outdoor activity. That was always fun. I remember one year I won the foot race and I got the cutest fan made out of feathers. I still have got part of that fan in my cedar chest. It was ball games a lot. I loved to play ball and at school we played ball. We didn’t have tournaments but we did play with the other towns a little bit. It wasn’t anything like it is today. It was just a great sport and our schoolhouse was just across the street from where the Internal Revenue Service building is right now. Of course, the best part of our life, I guess, was learning about the gospel. My folks saw to it that we were all ready for Sunday school in the mornings on Sunday and we would go to church. I always have liked going to church. The gospel has just been a big part in my life that has been important really. We would have ward reunions every year in February. My dad, his job was to gather up the food. All the whole town would make different things for the dinner and dad would come around in the bob sleigh and gather up the food and take it back up to the church house. Then he would stand at the door and take tickets. He would pin a little ribbon on everybody as they paid so everyone—you know, you knew who was entitled to come in. But that was fun. Then we would have a big dinner and then they would go upstairs in the meeting house and dance and have programs. It seemed like they all came home to do their chores around four o’clock and then everybody would go back again at night and they would have another lunch. I suppose the leftovers—I don’t know. Then we would have the big dance at night. The floors in that dance hall—I am surprised that they didn’t cave in. That was really, really fun. Our school house was right across the street there. I have two of the best teachers in my first grade and in my third grade, Miss Robins, I forgot her first name, and Miss Stallings. I just loved them. They were fun. Then we had Mr. Weissig later and Mr. Burnett was our principal. He lived to be over a hundred. He was a great man. Everybody loved him. But the boys, they played lots of ball. They had a lot of good athletes come out of this neighborhood. We talked a little bit about the missions. My two older brothers didn’t go on missions and I really believe it was because of lack of money. We were farmers and dad worked awfully hard but dad was—he believed in saving to buy something or pay for something. He didn’t believe in charging furniture and things like that. We had just the bare necessities. Then when his crops were paid—when he got the check for his crops in the fall he would get his bills all paid off but my brothers were both really good kids. I think it was lack of money. I don’t remember any of the boys really going on a mission. Maybe it was because I was younger. And then when I got out of high school—I went to the Weber High School up on 12th and Washington. When I got out of high school there was no money for college so I went to work at S.H. Crest Dime Store. I got on the minute I asked. He just hired me. Then I had no way to get back and forth to work. Us kids would walk up to town and the years earlier than that on a Sunday afternoon sometimes us girls would go walk to town to buy a malt, an ice cream cone. We would walk up there and just laugh all the way up and back a couple of miles. Sometimes we would go to a picture show. At that time picture shows were ten cents and fifteen cents. The Paramount was fifteen. One thing I remember so vividly and it was so much fun—on a Sunday afternoon after church and after dinner was all cleaned up and put away, dad would go out and hook up the big work horses, and he had a big bob sleigh and he would put a bunch of straw in it so it would be nice and comfortable and warm, and we were able to invite some of our friends to come and go with us. Mother would heat up the flat irons. Our flat irons were not electric; we heated them on the stove. But mother would wrap those up in a blanket and put a couple of blankets in the sleigh and we would go get in that big old bob sleigh and dad would take us clear down as far as west Weber, those horses trotting along. He had some great big sleigh bells that he hooked onto their harnesses and just that jingle jangle all the way down the road and us kids laughing in the sleigh and out of the sleigh, rolling around. It was just wonderful, an experience like that. I am not sure the year but I think it was about—let’s see, I was born in twenty—I think it was about in 1930 when that bank went broke. I had never heard dad and mother talk about losing their money. But I knew something was wrong with dad. He would just kind of mope around. I loved to be down around the barn with dad. I liked to go down and gather the eggs and things like that. I can just remember dad walking around just like he hurt and he lost all his money. I don’t suppose it was very much, I never did know how much, but he didn’t complain about it. We raised all our own food on the farm. We always had a big pit for potatoes and carrots and we always had apples. In the summertime we would just can or bottle, rather, peaches and apricots and pears and all kinds of fruit for the winter time. We were prepared. We talk about a two year supply, we certainly did our two year supply and we all helped do it. I just love to peel peaches to this day. It was great. Dad was very friendly and my friends were always welcome at my house. Dad liked to joke and kid them along, more so than mother did. Mother was more serious but it was fun to have friends. At night we would—we didn’t have televisions, we’d pop corn and we had an old grafonola, it was a real nice piece of furniture and we’d play records on it. I can’t remember too many of the songs but we had one called “Halleluiah, I’m a Bum!” We used to just love to hear that. And “The Red River Valley” and off the bat right now I can’t remember the songs, but it was just good entertainment for us and we’d play checkers and some kind of cards like Old Maid and Rummy, just a few games like that. My dad used to like to help people but he’d never—you didn’t know he was doing it. He would just go help. I had two aunts, one of my uncles was in the war and I know my dad took Aunt Edna food all the time and just help her out. He did the same thing for Aunt Eath, we helped them an awfully lot. On my mother’s side, grandma lived to be ninety years old. She had been a widow for many, many years. On Sunday afternoon we would drive over and get her wash—over to Wilson Lane, get her wash and bring back and we would wash it and iron it and then the next Sunday we would take that back to her clean and bring her soiled clothes back for the next week. My life it getting kind of near to the end. I am getting to be one of those old senior citizens. I have got a big family. I have five boys. My husband passed away almost eleven years ago. But I have had a life that I am so grateful for. I have just been blessed. I have had illnesses but when you think of what the Savior went through you don’t have anything to complain about. I am so thankful for the gospel in my life. It just has gotten me through any situation that I have had. I truly believe the gospel is true one hundred percent. Anybody that will follow and try to keep the commandments and try to keep their lives clean and helpful—charity is truly one of the greatest blessings you can give to other people. I certainly learned hard work when I was growing up and I have never been free from hard work. I love to work. I feel bad that I can’t work now. When I had to give up my flower garden I didn’t think I was going to make it, but my husband took the job over and all my kids have learned to work, every one of them. They have all learned to stay out of debt and to take care of their families. I think just learning to help other people and staying happy, be thankful for what the Lord has given you.;  .

BENSON Specialist in Charge of Club \Vork, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture Like the County Agent work, the Boys' and Girls' Club work began in the North and West in 1912. It has been conducted largely in cooperation with the Colleges of Agriculture through their extension departments, through which it has been closely coordinated with the public schoo\s.' Within the county the aim has been to secure club organization through the leadership of the County Superintendent of Schools and others. The county agents support the club movement as one of the:important agricultural activities of the county, advising the teachers in their club work in such ways as seem desirable. His chief support is given through his sympathy with the work, his technical knowledge, his assis­tance in the follow-up work, and his general guidance of the move­ment within the county. Club work aims to find undiscovered leaders and to give them opportunity for congenial work and for development through their interest in the children, their work with them, and their partner­ship with state and national leaders of large experience. Thus the country's own resources are being utilized for the benefit of the country. What is club work? Club work is a performance of a definite farm, garden, or home-interest enterprise and is based on the best economic practice of farm and home activities. It aims to teach better methods of agriculture and home economics. When coordi­nated with school work it serves greatly to increase interest in all of the school studies as well as the other activities of the commu­nity. Children from 10 to 18 years ofage are organized into local clubs, and these clubs are federated into a county, state, and national organization. The Work of the Clubs. Club projects are usually outlined to cover a season's work of from four to ten months. The club work may be closely correlated with school exercises and made to cover the entire year. Corn, potatoes, alfalfa, home garden, and canning clubs represent various types of club projects. When possible, the members of the clubs are allowed to receive and keep the net profits resulting from their club work. The work requires careful study of instructions, the making of observations, the keeping of accurate records, the making of exhibits at fairs, and the grading" crating, and marketing of their products.--14--Ob}ects of Club Work. The principal objects of club work may be listed as follows: 1. To offer to the young people careful guidance which will lead to a better type of farmers and home-builders. 2. To demonstrate, through the boys and girls, the best farm and home practices. 3. To enlist the interest and efforts of the boys and girls in problems of efficiency and economy. 4. To demonstrate best methods of handling farm products and preventing waste in orchard, field, and garden through home canning and better systems of marketing. 5. To offer to young people the proper incentive for their own personal conservation and the conservation of American farm life. 6. To cultivate in boys and girls habits of industry and thrift. During the past two years it has been discovered that the Boys' and Girls' Club work has assisted the public schools in making the classroom and the home-study work more interesting, and in many instances County Superintendents and teachers have given credit for club activities in connection with the related subjects at school. The teachers find that the club work offers an opportunity to trans­late the theory of text-book and classroom into action and gives the work more human interest and that, instead of 'interfering with the school work, it has proven of distinct value to the cultural side of the child's life. In addition to this the work at home has proven of distinct educational value. Club work, however interesting to the children and however excellent in itself, is not the whole object of the work. The club idea includes the interests of the children as children and the interest of their parents. It contemplates the future man or woman and therefore becomes a very valuable part of the whole system of public education by combining the class­room instruction with the farm and home enterprises, the child's play activities with the child's club contest activities, and in these combinations it becomes an easy matter to cultivate a love for nature, labor, and proper habits of thinking, working, and achieve­ment. At the end of the second year we find that there has been a remarkable increase in enrollment of Club members, and a definite increase in interest, public spirit, and sentiment back of the move­ment. A large percentage of club members who enrolled the first year were members the second year, thus profiting by the instruc­tion and experience of the past. There has been a marked gain in efficiency this second year over that of the first, and a better spirit towards the farm and farm home. There has been a much larger attendance the second year over the first year in the club work, or any previous year, in the matter of boys' and girls' atten---15--dance at short courses, agricultural colleges, and state fair schools of instruction. There has also been a very marked increase in the local financial support of the club projects throughout the States. Club Work as a School Extension. The essence of the extension idea is that the agencies provided for the education of the people shall not confine their work within the walls of the schoolhouses and colleges. The school and the college should work for all per- .:'~. sons who need the knowledge which school and college can impart, the training which they can give, and the inspiration which comes from the living presence of the gifted teacher. The common school is responding to this new and enlarging idea of service; and this response is finding its outlet in efforts to connect the school work directly with what we sometimes call real life-that is, the life that is lived by men and women and children in the homes, who are doing the home work and the tasks of the farm and the shop, and indeed every other industry. The school may well feel that it has continuing relations with its pupils; that it has duties to them and to their parents wherever they may be, whether at school, at home, in study, and in both work and play. So the com­mon school has its (I extension functions" which it can perform more effectively through club-work interests and activities, which can ,be made most efficient for usefulness and for educational guidance' during the long summer vacations. o;  .

Strategic Planning: Action Highlight By Kim Rollins Goal: The UVU Library will enhance the organization. Objective 4.2: Review staffing structure and needs by December 2012 Activity: Benchmark staffing and budgets in similar libraries Activity: Investigate the alignment of current staffing and library needs Mike and Lesli have been working on the strategic planning goal of comparing our library with UVU’s designated peer institution libraries in terms of staffing size and structure, as well as all other areas. This information will be helpful in informing the UVU administration about the Library’s staffing needs, especially as we approach the PBA process. Along with Mike’s data comparisons, Lesli is looking at staffing structures and processes that might be of interest to us as we grow and improve. Below are a few of these comparisons for your information. Did you know faculty can now check out books for a whole semester? We recently announced that the faculty loan period for books is now 16 weeks. To renew items, faculty will bring materials to the Circulation Desk, and we will renew them for an additional 16 weeks. Check out periods remain the same for all other items. If faculty need DVDs or videos for extended classroom use, they can contact Christy for assistance.

Fall Break Hours The Library will be on limited hours during fall break, from October 11—13. Halloween Costume Contest The Library will be holding its annual Halloween costume contest on October 31. We plan on having several special guest appearances. Keep an eye out for more information! At Your Service By Lesli Baker Last spring, I participated in the campus Do Something Great initiative to help improve customer service on campus. Providing outstanding customer service is such an important part of what we do that I am bringing back our At Your Service column in the staff newsletter to share with you ideas from the Do Something Great training. Creating a service culture takes time and effort. But, how do we know when we have a service culture? Here are a few indicators to help us recognize how we are doing:  People take responsibility.  There are few barriers to communication and action.  People are responsive to the needs of internal and external customers.  People are friendly and courteous toward each other.  Front-line staff frequently ask if they can be of service.  People smile and look like they enjoy their work.  People continuously look for ways to improve.  Staff feel empowered to act. So how do you think we are doing? Take a moment to reflect on how you are doing on these individually as well as how the library is doing overall. I welcome your input on where and how we can improve! INFORMATION COMMONER 3 By Mark Stevens Symphony Upgraded to 4.3.1 As per request from Azucena Aguayo, our Symphony server was recently upgraded to version 4.3.1 (service pack 1) without downtime, or impact to the library community. Azucena’s persistence in this regard keeps us current on the latest release of Symphony, and in this particular case, also permits additional functionality (such as the mass edit capability). Sometime this fall, we plan to also upgrade to 4.3.1, service pack 2. Again we do not expect significant downtime. Symphony Catalog MARC Extract and Delivery Has Been Automated The new EDS Discovery Resource requires continual synchronization with the changes that occur within the Symphony catalog. It usually takes about 30 minutes (each day) to manually run the report, format the output, and perform the FTP upload and verification of the quarter GB file. We’ve now created a scheduled script and processes to automatically perform most of these steps each evening. The formatted dump occurs in the afternoon and the FTP upload takes place at 6:00 PM. It appears to take EDS about 48 hours to reflect Symphony catalog changes within the Discovery interface. Archives ContentDM Server Upgrade Approved The ContentDM 6.1 application upgrade ran into a dead end because our SUSE Linux operating system license and support is not compatible with Novell. We must change to Red Hat Linux, (or its CentOS clone). Accordingly, we’ve proposed to UVU Library administration that we seize a silver lining from this situation by creating a new, upgraded ContentDM server with much greater amounts of RAM, CPU, and as much as a terabyte of file storage (with automated backups). This will hopefully provide a robust platform for the new video streaming capabilities that ContentDM 6.1 enjoys. Our request has been approved, and we are preparing the request specifications for the new server from UVU Campus IT. OneSearch Discovery Layer Training Both onsite and online training for the new UVU Library Discovery Layer will be made available in the coming weeks. A meeting will be held during the week of September 24 to find specific dates and times. In the meantime, please let us know of suggestions, bugs, etc. that you have encountered while conducting searches. Libstats Knowledge Base Server A project has been created with Campus IT to investigate the establishment of a new reference knowledge capture database called Libstats. Once the server is approved and created by Campus IT, the new application is intended to help us capture and organize questions that are asked by patrons so the answers can be referenced by subsequent reference librarians. Trevor Young (of the Emerging Technologies Committee) has provided the information we needed to pursue this project based on his past professional contacts. News from Systems 4 INFORMATION COMMONER News from Access Services A Pager’s Tale By Tony Jaskowick Need a reserve book? But the one copy is out… We can now page you. Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Scholastics, there existed a Library staffed by many helpful and happy people. These people desired only to help their patrons and visitors to the fullest of their abilities. But sometimes, sadness would befall them as the titles requested by the patrons (titles of great power known as the Reserve Textbooks) would be checked out and the patron making the request wouldn’t have time to wait by the desk for the book to return. This continued for many ages until, one day, a strange star fell from the sky. When the Library workers gathered around the debris of the wreckage, they were amazed to see alien technology strewn about. The village elders were called and a council convened. Many questions were asked but no answers were found until a voice from the ether spoke to the Access Services Mystic. The voice said that the devices were a gift from the literary gods and that the Library was to use the technology to enhance the patron service. The mystic, who was the leader of the workers, decreed that these new alien devices would be used to alert the patrons as to when the reserve books were returned. It was believed that this would alleviate some of the sadness that occurred at those times of peril. And now a translation for those of you that didn’t care for the story: The circulation suite now has a paging system for notifying patrons that a reserve textbook they want has been returned. News from ERES By Alan Stephens Visiting with faculty members during faculty convocation has paid off big dividends for Electronic Reserve. Since August, I’ve added 104 new videos for streaming, including material from 16 professors who have never used the streaming service before. I’ve also posted 60 student projects for Behavioral Science and Biology classes and more than 100 performance critiques for ten different dance classes. With the new semester upon us I thought it would be a good idea to review the password formats for Electronic Reserve. There are two types of ERES passwords: the basic course password, which is used for the majority of ERES pages, and the password for the Nursing Department’s videos. Continued on next page.

INFORMATION COMMONER 5 By Themselves Markus Aedo I'm currently a senior, majoring in digital media with an emphasis in cinema production. I would like to pursue a career in video journalism and make documentaries and movies. I was born in the circus and traveled for most of my childhood. Other interests and hobbies I have include traveling, watching movies, cooking, and getting to know more about the strange and bizarre. Roxana Boyer I'm from Peru and have been here for two years. This is my third semester. I am majoring in social work. I didn’t study English in my country, but I love this language. So for this reason need to learn more English. I have a seven year old daughter. We came to the US for a better life. I am a single mom. I am very thankful that this country opened its arms. Continued on next page. New Library Aide Introductions Continued from previous page. The basic format is the instructor’s last name followed by the department abbreviation and course number all entered in lower case. For instructors with hyphenated last names just use the portion of the name before the hyphen. Examples: The password for Archaeology 1100 taught by Alex Stecker would be steckerarch1100. For Anthropology 107G taught by Gwen Anderson the password would be andersonanth107g. And finally the password for Angie Banchero-Kelleher’s Dance 4150 class the password would be bancherodanc4150. The nursing videos are a special case. Due to licensing agreements, students may only get the course password for the nursing videos from their instructors so if someone asks for the password for the Taylor Skills or obstetrical nursing videos you will have to tell him/her to talk to his/her instructor. Most of the videos on ERES as well as a handful of documents have their own password. So, for a student to be able to view one of these items she will need to have the course password and the password for the item. As is the case with the course passwords for the nursing videos, students must get those passwords from their instructors. 6 INFORMATION COMMONER Continued from previous page. Whitney Collins I want to major in dance here at UVU. I am a freshman this year and I am taking 18 credits! I work 20 hours a week on top of this crazy, yet awesome, schedule! I love to dance. I have trained in: jazz, lyrical, contemporary, ballet, modern, Hip-Hop, high school drill team, and a little bit of tap. I want to become more educated in modern, ballet, and even learn some ballroom. I dream of becoming a professional choreographer. Ben Gines I'm from a small Idaho town called Wendell, which is near Twin Falls if anyone knows where that is. I recently transferred from Utah State to finish my degree in electrical automation and robotics. Afterwards, I plan on getting an MBA. I served a mission in Hong Kong where I learned Mandarin and Cantonese and fell in love with the Chinese culture. I enjoy sports of almost any kind, as well as the outdoors. And that's me. Chad Harward I am a freshman studying nursing so I still have a long ways to go. I currently live in American Fork with my wife and our five kids. I love to fish, hunt, and camp. I also like to mountain bike when I am able. I have done a lot of traveling for my past work and the military. Gregory Hodgson I'm a CS major seeking a BS in CS emphasis. That is an anomaly because I have fairly good interpersonal communication skills. I was formerly a garbage man here in Orem for many years and before that I did a lot of different types of construction work. I also worked at Pioneer Book. I mostly am interested in technical things such as electronics, but I also love physical activity such as sports. I channel this mostly by running because it doesn't require much but time. I have run a marathon and a handful of half marathons. I am married and my wife is a school teacher. I proudly hail from the south side of the city of Phoenix, AZ. Antonio Zuta This is my third semester and I am studying emergency services trying to be a paramedic. I have been married for three years, but no kids yet. I like to read a lot of books and listen to music, and also enjoy photography. I am originally from Lima, Peru, and, of course, I speak Spanish . By Christy Cathro Goodnight Heather and I will be out of town attending the National Media Market from Monday, October 1 through Thursday, October 4. The Media office will be closed at this time because we currently do not have a work study student. The second floor is already hopping with fall students. If you need help finding anything, feel free to swing by LI 214 and grab one of us to help you. The media viewing rooms are listed in the group study rooms scheduling software, just as a reminder, so students can schedule them in advance. 21st Century Media Donation Policy Big news! We will no longer accept VHS donations of any kind. We are doing this for many reasons, but mainly because students in the 21st century just do not own VHS players and have no use for such antiquated technology. Thus, we will no longer accept them because our community no longer wants them either. There are VHS players available for check out at the first floor Circulation Desk, but the odds are incredibly low that a student will go through the trouble to check out a player just to watch an old VHS movie. New films are no longer being produced on VHS. VHS, in a way, could be looked at now as a vehicle for historical study (vhs), like music cassette tapes before them. They are technology that has been long surpassed in both quality and quantity. We are adjusting our collection development policy to reflect these changes. Grow with us into the 21st century and help us leave VHS in the past! INFORMATION COMMONER 7 News from Media News from Technical Services By Keith Rowley Again “busy” is the best way to describe how things are in Technical Services. Orders for this new fiscal year are being entered as fast as possible. Because of the big batches of orders at the end of spring, cataloging had a massive amount of books to catalog this last summer. Fortunately the flood has slowed way down so other things can get done. We are again working on donations, which haven’t slowed down any. Look for the book sale of not needed donated books to happen soon. The latest Safari ebook update brings us from 3,760 to 5,062 titles. Shuyi fractured a bone in her right foot so she will be wearing a walking cast for the next little while. Hopefully she’ll be all better soon. EDITORIAL INFORMATION The Information Commoner is an internal communication tool published once a month by and for the Utah Valley University Library staff. Input from all library staff is encouraged. The deadline for information submittal is the third Friday of each month. Send information to Lesli via email. By Sarah Rice Introducing! Serials is very happy to introduce two new library aides beginning this fall semester, Jimmy Hall and Melissa Memmott. Jimmy originates from the small retirement town of Sequim, WA. He moved to Orem to attend UVU fall 2010 and is majoring in communication in journalism and minoring in cinema studies. Playing guitar, writing, and watching any and all movies are a few of his hobbies. His career goal is to write for the web on entertainment such as movies, music, and technology. Melissa is a also a communications major. She has an associate’s degree from Snow College where she studied theater arts. When she's not studying, she likes to play the harp, take care of her niece and nephew, and watch Once Upon A Time. She enjoys working with the Serials department and is looking forward to being here the rest of the year. Law Collection Project Completed As you are aware, the law collection was moved from the compact shelving to the short periodical shelving behind the current periodical collection. The volumes were physically relocated and also required a change in home location in the Symphony record. Serials has completed a project changing the home location of each of these volumes from Compact to Law, to reflect their new location. A special thanks to KJ who worked so hard to complete this project. Damaged Items Please send any and all mutilated or damaged items to Serials for repair. Please do not repair monographs or periodicals yourself. We have noticed items being sent to us for repairs after having been repaired with scotch tape or other methods. This can actually cause more damage to the item. Due to binding requirements and repair processes, we must repair items using specific methods. Items needing repair should be brought to my desk. Staff Leave I will continue to be on partial maternity leave until the end of the year. 8 INFORMATION COMMONER News from Serials By Annie Smith This month the Library’s site changed radically. We’re the first site on campus to adopt the new University template, and Web Development Services designed a brand new look for our pages. The new homepage prominently features our newest research tool, OneSearch. OneSearch is our name for EBSCO’s Discovery Service, one the major players in federated and aggregated searching. It allows users to search all but a very small portion of the Library’s materials from one interface. We’ve already started using OneSearch in our instruction workshops with students. Personally, I’ve already seen the benefits of OneSearch. We can get students actively searching much more quickly than we could before, when we would help students select the right databases for their search. Because OneSearch allows students to find staggering amounts of information about their topics, we have been spending more time showing students how to use the database’s filters to refine their searches. With the dramatic change the homepage and the arrival of OneSearch, I have seen more questions at the reference desk about how to locate individual databases for more advanced searching. To get to them, users need to click on the Articles tab on the homepage and you’ll see the old drop down menu with the list of subjects and the link to the complete list of databases. OneSearch, while it does mean changes for how we teach and how we answer research questions, is a step forward for doing research. Instead of searching databases and the catalog separately, students will see their expectations of one stop searching realized. After all, how many of us have heard students wish that our databases were more like Google? OneSearch is our answer to that question. INFORMATION COMMONER 9 News from Reference/Instruction OneSearch can sometimes bring back millions of results. News from the George Sutherland Archives By Catherine McIntyre We were awarded an LSTA grant for $10,000 to digitize the UVU Student newspaper back to 1966. Archives also received a mini-grant from the Utah State Historical Records Administration Board (USHRAB) to pay for materials preservation and repair training for Aimee Bastarache and Sarah Rice. We are hosting a small exhibit of archive materials that reflect the U.S. Constitution in action. This is in honor of Constitution Week. October is National Archives Month. We will be hosting a collection of items symbolizing the “Old West,” many of them on loan from Dr. Roger Blomquist, an adjunct history professor on campus. We will have a new intern starting on September 25. Her name is Ligia Quiroz and she is a major in history. She will be helping me with several projects and with other tasks as needed. Brent, Aimee, and I participated in a panel discussion with Mike and Trevor Young as part of the 25th Annual Ethics Week Forums. Our discussion, called “Burning Books: Ethical Dilemmas in Today’s Libraries,” dealt with difficult decisions that libraries have to make regarding weeding, format choices (digital versus analog), duration and preservation of digital formats, what materials deserve archiving, and purchasing (or not) controversial materials. Archives and Digitization Aimee created a small preservation/repair lab in the Archives work room with materials she purchased through the grant she was awarded from the Utah State Historical Records Administration Board (USHRAB) Brent created a small studio in the Archives work room in which we will conduct oral history interviews. It has sound-proofing, special green-and black-screens, and moveable lighting. 10 INFORMATION COMMONER;  .

WILSON.---....0,••--- One of the farm products which Nevada raises in large quantities and of excellent quality is the potato. At the Station grounds, for the sea­son of 1891, 52 selections were, made from 90 varieties. the object in selecting being to reduce the number under cultivation, choosing only those that had given the best returns. . These were planted near the central portion of the grounds. the soil being practically the same as described in Bulletin No. 13, sandy, gravely, with a small portion of clay. The land selected for the experiment with the 52 varieties was a quarter-acre plat which had been manured at the rate of 35 two-horse loads per acre, and was plowed in February, 189I. For the varieties planted in larger area, halt-acre plats were used, occupying land seeded to alfalfa. These were plowed in March, '91, using from four to six horses. Dynamite was used in blasting rock, of which many tons were removed, together with a large quantity of alfalfa roots. The ground was well harrowed and crossplowed. A fter the second plowing more rock and alfalfa roots were removed. The harrow was used again, followed by a" smoother." PLANTING. The rows were laid off three feet apart, running a light furrow for the ~~eed. which was cut to two eyes. In planting, one piece of seed was used to each hill; the hills were placed exactly two feet apart. Fifty-four hills of each variety were planted. The covering was done with a single shovel plow to a depth of about four inches. -2- The date of planting, for one to thirty-two, was April 30th; for thirty-three to fifty-two, May 6th. With more than a usual amount of rain and an excess of cool weather, the coming up was not rapid, the majority showing from May 23 to 28. The cultivation, largely done with a single shovel plow, was suffi­cient to keep the ground in good condition and clear of weeds. IRRIGATION. Furrows, fairly deep, were made between the rows to carry the water and also keep it below the potatoes, instead of allowing it to come up onto the hills. The plat occupied by the 52 varieties was irrigated June 5, 18, 27; July 5, II, 18, 29; August 4, 13 and 25. The half-acre plats, on.which grew the Morning Star, Fearnaught White Star, Early Rose, White Flower, St. Patrick, Rough Diamond, Early Sunrise, Stray Beauty and Summit were irrigated on June 3, 17, '26; July 5, II, 20, 28; August 4, 12 and 25.

The per cent. of small potatoes is least with one eye and greatest where whole potatoes were used. although the latter gives best results for total weight. HALF-ACRE PLATS. In the table below are given notes on varieties grown on the half-acre plats, area given to each, yield in pounds, and calculated yield in . bushels per acre. nne of the varieties. the Rough Diamond, varies in appearance from the usual more than any potato we have. It has a rough. brown skin, and nearly round in shape. Some.who have tried it pronounce it a fair cooking potato, while others say it has nothing of value except its blight resisting qualities. The plantings of June 1st, June 15th, and July 1st, were for a limited test of late planting. The Early Sunrise 01 July 1st, ripened and produced good sized potatoes. From 58 hills we harvested of large potatoes 24J4' pounds, of small potatoes 8~ pounds. Three hundred and nine hills of the Early Sun­rise, planted May 11th, using the seed end, yielded of large potatoes 94J4' pounds, of small potatoes 22 pounds.. I I ...~ :::l Arf'ain Yield- ?"Q.

The 52 varieties grown on quarter-acte plats were dug on October 13th and 14th. In sorting and weighing potatoes classed as small, an average sample measured 231z xIU inches, and weighed 231z' ounces. The same basis ofsorting was followed with the varieties g-rown on the ~alf-acre plats. As p'reviously noted, 54 hills were planted of each variety. The following table gives the number of hills germinated, weight of large and small potgtoes, total and calculated yield to the full stand of 54 hills. LAnGE, NA:\JE. DATE l'LANTED.

This speaks well for Nevada's potato crop, which should become a source of considerable revenue to Nevada farmers. It may be said that in judging the quality of a potato by the amount of dry matter present, that a good potato should contain at least 25 per cent. dry matter; a fair potato. 1rom 2 I to 23 per cent.; below this potatoes are of a poor quality.

Information Commoner : Keeping Library Staff on Common Ground, 2012 Summer; Information Commoner Summer 2012 Volume 6, Issue 7 Keeping Library Staff on Common Ground In This Issue Announcements 2 Department News 2 Conference Reports 8 Employee Spotlights 11 Brag Box 11 Vacation Schedules 12 What’s Our Policy? Mike’s Message Summer is the time for taking vacations and soaking up some sun. For those of you with a good deal of vacation time accumulated, please don’t wait until December and have weeks of vacation to burn at the end of the year. (Can this really be true?) Summer is also time for taking care of those projects postponed during the busy semesters. As our biorhythms crank down, be careful not to reach the end of summer wondering where the time went. Summer is the time for space adjustments. The Innovation Center is moving their lab into LI 213 while retaining the two group study rooms on the first floor as office space. Media is shifting the music CD and music score collections to the opposite side in to allow for expansion on the south side. Summer is the time for closing out the old budget and starting a new one. In general, we do not purchase items in June as we hope get a clearer idea of how much we can pre-pay Ebsco to clear out our accounts. Unattended Children By Lesli Baker It’s that time of year when we occasionally see parents leaving their children alone in the Library while attending class. As part of our Patron Conduct Guidelines, we state that children must be accompanied by an adult at all times. The University Police Department asks that we contact them to assess the situation when we see an unattended child in the building. 2 INFORMATION COMMONER Announcements Summer Hours and Closures The Library will be closed on the following holidays: Memorial Day May 28 Independence Day July 4 Pioneer Day July 24 We will also be on shortened hours during the semester break, from August 11-25. Please check the calendar for details: www.uvu.edu/library/about/hours.html. . By Judy Robertson Circulation is surviving all the health absences, vacant positions, and vacations this past year. I personally would like to thank my co-workers for always stepping up to the task of filling the vacant time slots, working several shifts, and sometimes multiple evenings to keep the problems behind the scenes at a minimum. Thanks to those who have stepped out of their areas to cover the Circulation Desk. I appreciate everyone and think you are fantastic! Thank you for all the nice thoughts, well wishes, and prayers on Garth’s (Toby’s) behalf. It has been a difficult time, but he is progressing. His kidney is functioning well, his pneumonia is gone, and we are working on his blood pressure. We are taking a vacation near the end of May to southeast Utah. Hopefully, the legend of Kokopelli is true and he will bless us with replenishment and health…maybe skip the fertility and mischief part. EDITORIAL INFORMATION The Information Commoner is an internal communication tool published once a month by and for the Utah Valley University Library staff. Input from all library staff is encouraged. The deadline for information submittal is the third Friday of each month. Send information to Lesli via email. News from Access Services INFORMATION COMMONER 3 By Mark Stevens Netflix Roku Box in Pre-Rollout Testing Phase The Emerging Technologies Committee is completing tests of a Netflix account associated with a Roku box. The Netflix account is locked to the Roku hardware, permitting immediate streaming anywhere a faculty member or patron might tap into the Internet. Due to bandwidth and login issues, the Roku boxes can’t be used to stream videos wirelessly right now; they must be plugged into a wired Internet connection. We will evaluate this flexible technology as a complement to our UVU Library video-streaming resource offerings. Symphony OPAC My Account LDAP Status We continue to work with the SirsiDynix LDAP specialist and the Campus IT LDAP specialists in an attempt to make the Symphony OPAC My Account authentication work with the central campus LDAP server. If we get this project across the finish line, UVU Library patrons will be able to access the OPAC My Account module with the same password they have with UVLink. We’ve solved a number of problems so far, but at least one significant challenge remains. We are starting a parallel effort to implement LDAP for our ILLiad logins as well. UVU Library Discovery Service Selection and Implementation Our selection committee hit the deadline to submit all the necessary documentation to the campus business office to permit vendor responses. We will choose one provider to implement a discovery service this fiscal year. In a nutshell, this discovery service delivers a “one-stop-shopping” resource that rivals Google in simplicity and greatly surpasses Google for locating relevant, reliable, and scholarly journal articles, books, and media. The contents of our library catalog will be included in the search results. The current path forward is as follows:  A chosen discovery service will be implemented and available for general use in June.  We will react to summertime feedback from our staff and patrons to refine and optimize the user interface experience.  Other adjustments (such as tweaking the library instruction presentation and library webpages) should be completed in time to address the blitz of returning students and library instruction classes of Fall 2012. We express our appreciation to everyone that has contributed to this project to reach this point. We’d like to give a special thanks to Carly Nielson for helping us navigate the formal purchasing processes. News from Systems Roku boxes are much smaller than you might think. 4 INFORMATION COMMONER News from Reference/Instruction By Annie Smith Recently, Google began to include page previews on their results page to give users a better idea of what they’re clicking on. If you hover to the right of any result, a pair of arrows will appear and a snapshot of the page will load in the far right of the screen. Google is planning more changes to their search engine this summer. You may have already seen some of them in action. In order to improve the relevance of their results, Google will start including information in the sidebar for certain searches. They’re calling this their Knowledge Graph. For example, with searches for famous people or other simple searches, Google will include information from their pages on Wikipedia. Google will also give greater emphasis to currency by giving the “date of last update” more weight in their search algorithm. With luck, these changes will last. Google has a history of discontinuing features if they’re not used often enough. Last summer, Google got rid of their “wonder wheel”—a feature that allowed users to browse through related terms and topics in a spider graph—because of low usage. I also have interesting information to report from attending the annual ULA Conference and the annual LOEX conference in Columbus, Ohio. The conference reports are included in this newsletter starting on page 8. Google Page Preview of UVU’s homepage. Google shows information about UVU directly on the search results page. INFORMATION COMMONER 5 News from Media By Christy Goodnight I returned from traveling around the globe this month. I left to take part in the Semester at Sea program on board the MV Explorer as their assistant librarian. The librarian on board each voyage is always from the University of Virginia Libraries. The librarian this time was Jean Cooper, their Grants, Sponsored Programs and Instructional Services Librarian. 570 students from 45 different states and 19 different countries joined approximately 70 staff and faculty members and 58 family members, including the two year old daughter of a faculty member—our youngest sailor this semester. There were also 50 lifelong learners on board who are adult students that audit classes and provide valuable perspectives from a variety of backgrounds, many who have traveled with Semester at Sea multiple times. Over the 105 days at sea after picking up the students in Nassau, the ship traversed the globe visiting 12 separate countries. Due to technological difficulties on board the ship, I was not able to keep in touch or upload as many pictures as I anticipated sharing. Thus, on June 8, I will do a lunchtime presentation of my travel diary from the voyage and answer any questions anyone has about Semester at Sea. Feel free to bring your lunch. We are changing up the second floor. We've moved the CDs to the mezzanine (west of the microfilm cases, above the family study room) and the music scores are now on the north end of the second floor stacks. The media collection (DVDs, VHS, and so forth) are going to be inventoried, weeded, and shifted through the rest of the summer. Please bear with us as we move the collection bit by bit. We will eventually add a stack or two of shelving to the south end of the media collection at some point in the future as the collection grows (possibly one this summer). Dominica, January 2012 Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, May 2012 6 INFORMATION COMMONER News from the Sutherland Archives By Catherine McIntyre From April 9-20, we hosted an exhibit for Deaf Studies about the history and development of assistive devices including very early models of TTYs, alerting devices such as flashing alarm clocks, closed-caption decoders for televisions, and much more. The exhibit was in conjunction with the fifth biennial national Deaf Studies Today! Conference, hosted at UVU. Brent estimated that over 300 people visited the display in the Archives. On Friday, June 8, at 7:00-8:30 PM, the Archives will be hosting the presentation “Tabernacle Memories and Meanings: South Central Utah” in the Library Lecture Hall. This presentation is part of an ongoing oral history project, Continued on next page. By Sarah Rice Serials wishes everyone a happy summer semester! Orange and Green Stickers Just a reminder, when shelving periodicals, look at each issue carefully. If there is an orange fluorescent circle on the call number tab, then that issue should be shelved on the compact shelves in a box. The same applies to any call number tab with a fluorescent green sticker: it should be shelved in the bound periodical collection. If the issue has just a call number tab with no colored stickers, it should be shelved in the current periodical collection. The most current issue should be placed inside the clear plastic cover. You will need to check the date to see if the issue you are shelving is more current than the one in the cover and if not, it should be placed inside the shelf. By lifting up the display shelf you will see a stack of the older issues. Items for Repair Please send any and all mutilated or damaged items to Serials for repair, especially periodical issues. Due to binding requirements, we must repair those using specific methods. Be sure to bring mending items to Sarah or Wendy to be properly checked out so that the record reflects that they are being mended, otherwise no one will be able to locate them! Staff Leave I will be on leave in May and will return mid-June. Mail delivery and pick up, material check in, mending and periodical routing to faculty and staff will be temporarily taken care of by Wendy. If you have any questions, please contact Wendy at x8318. News from Serials Continued from previous page. conducted by Drs. Simon Fass and Ron Smith of the University of Texas-Dallas, to document the deep significance that individuals attach to the Mormon tabernacles in their towns. Members of the LDS Church, of course, often have a spiritual bond with the tabernacles, but these historic buildings are loved by others because of their architectural beauty, history, and role as a gathering place for all residents, regardless of religion, to attend concerts, plays, graduation ceremonies, patriotic programs, and other cultural events. The tabernacles covered in this portion of the project were in Provo, Vernal, Manti, Spring City, Heber City, and American Fork. The researchers had already completed project interviews in southern Utah, and will concentrate on northern Utah next. They plan to eventually incorporate the interviews and photographs into a book they will publish. We are grant partners with Drs. Fass and Smith. I, along with Archives volunteer Kellie Johnson, transcribed and proofread the interviews. Brent has been tracking down historic and modern photos of the tabernacles and has created a beautiful publicity poster. The presentation will be open to the public, and I hope that you’ll consider attending. Many of the interviewees will be here, and it promises to be an engaging examination of the many ways in which these beautiful historic buildings have enriched the lives of those who have lived near them. For Summer University on May 15, Aimee, Mike, and I presented a session on UVU’s history and its many changes, and talked about what the Archives does and the materials we want to preserve, and how attendees can contribute. Aimee presented the basics of how to preserve documents and photographs that people have at home, and what resources are available to help. Brent, just back from vacation, contributed great information about how to best try to preserve digital materials, and Mike kept things lively by asking UVU history trivia questions. Barbara Hammond, coordinator for the new UVU history book, asked attendees to keep in mind how they or someone they know could contribute to that project. We gave out treats and had a drawing for two really nice Home Preservation Kits that Aimee had assembled. Attendance was good, and overall, everyone learned something. We made new contacts, and we all had a good time. INFORMATION COMMONER 7 8 INFORMATION COMMONER Conference Report: ULA Annual Conference 2012 By Annie Smith Keynote Molly Raphael, current president of the American Library Association, delivered the keynote address on Thursday, April 26. She covered current trends in the library world such as declining funds in a time of increased library use and battles with publishers over ebooks. In the question and answer session that followed, Ms. Raphael reported on the ALA’s efforts to enlighten publishers and authors about ebooks from a library perspective. In discussing publisher restrictions on ebooks, Ms. Raphael mentioned that some libraries “were okay” with HarperCollins restrictions to 26 check outs per book before the library had to re-purchase it. Ms. Raphael thought it wasn’t worth it to draw the proverbial line in the sand over the 26 check out restriction, but to my way of thinking, libraries shouldn’t knuckle under to things like this. It sets a bad precedent. Publish or Perish: Honest Perspectives from Naïve Librarians Erin Davis, Kacy Lundstrom, and Pamela Martin from Utah State University Library presented on their experiences in researching, writing, and publishing an article for a peer-reviewed publication. I wish I had been able to see this presentation a year ago when Lesli and I were writing and getting our own article published. They had some very useful advice about not only how to organize the research and work with co-authors, but also how to persevere in the face of publisher rejection. In fact, a lot of their advice came down to that one verb: persevere. The Medium Defines the Message Claire Hamasu and John Bramble, librarians from the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, shared some best practices for creating a coherent social media program. They had some very interesting advice about which tones to adopt for different types of social media. One of the most useful parts of the presentation was when Hamasu and Bramble divided the audience into groups and had us create our own social media communication plans. A lot of very interesting ideas about specific content to post came out of it. From The Lost Cyclist to The Lost City of Z: Running a Nonfiction Book Club Presented by Dan Berube of the Whitmore Public Library and Suzanne Johnson of the Millcreek Public Library, this program offered advice and book recommendations for starting a nonfiction book club. I get the impression that the presenters were mostly expecting public librarians in their audience, because they glossed over a lot of information that would have been useful in the development and advertising phases of getting a book club up and running. The bulk of their presentation actually consisted of book recommendations. I would have liked to see more information about how to lead discussions and get patrons involved in book clubs, etc. Conference Report: LOEX 2012 By Annie Smith Keynote Speaker: Char Booth Char Booth, a librarian at the Claremont Colleges in California, gave the opening keynote address. Her presentation shared her library’s innovative approaches to serving the seven colleges that make up Claremont. She stressed the importance of not only advocating for your libraries, but of redefining them in our users’ minds. Many people have a firm mental image of libraries as “those places where they keep books.” We know that libraries are much more than that, and it’s up to us to get the word out. Socializing with the Undead: Humans vs. Zombies and Learning in the Library—Jessica Olin, Hiram College Olin was the first to admit that her plan to introduce Humans vs. Zombies (http://humansvszombies.org/) to her library was intended as a purely promotional event to get people through the doors of the library. But several rules of the game turned the promotional event into an impromptu library orientation. To keep gameplay interesting, the moderators would announce that bonuses were available in certain locations in the library or that other locations had been contaminated with the zombie virus. These announcements encouraged students to learn their way around the library. Create Your Own Cephalonian Adventure—Amanda Izenstark and Mary MacDonald, University of Rhode Island The Cephalonian Method involves distributing questions among the audience and then calling on the audience to ask questions. This creates a non-linear presentation of information, but it serves to liven up the atmosphere. The research on this method also shows that seeding the audience with questions encourages others to come up with their own questions. Creating Insanely Great Instruction Sessions: What Librarians Can Learn from Steve Jobs—Matthew Olsen, Southeast Missouri State University Olsen shared five techniques that we can steal from Steve Jobs’ presentation style to improve our speaking abilities. They boil down to:  Focus on the User: Use the second person pronoun (you) to put the emphasis on the listener. Present the information in terms of how your audience will actually use their library research skills.  Tell Stories: Stories are a powerful method of communicating important background information or explanations.  Learn to Say No: We need to focus on the essentials, what students really need to know, rather than trying to explain everything in a 50 minute class session.  Have a Message: Messages are short, concise sentences or slogans that stick in listeners’ minds after they forget everything else. Continued on next page. INFORMATION COMMONER 9 Continued from previous page.  Be Passionate: If we don’t care about the information, our audiences won’t care either. We need to show enthusiasm to inspire enthusiasm in others. iPod Apps, Mobile Learning, Game Dynamics: This Ain’t Your Typical Library Orientation—Anne Burke and Adrienne Lai, North Carolina State University Instead of going low tech as we have done here at UVU, Burke and Lai went high tech and sent their students on scavenger hunts through the library with camera-enabled iPod Touches. Students were divided into teams, given a series of tasks or things to find and an iPod Touch. They would post their results to the free Evernote app on the iPods and have them scored by a librarian and an assistant. This scavenger hunt has been so successful that Burke and Lai were awarded the ACRL CLS ProQuest Award for Innovation in College Librarianship. Second Keynote Speaker: Brian Stone Brian Stone teaches design at Ohio State University. He shared his thoughts on creating an ideal learning environment, one in which students are encouraged toward inquiry, creativity, and collaboration. Set the Stage: How to Use Performance Theory to Create Effective Self-Introductions and Positive Learning Environments—Joshua Vossler (Coastal Carolina University) and John Watts (Webster University) This highly entertaining session was based around the importance of creating memorable, humanizing self-introductions during instruction sessions. The presenters made the observation that we tend to skip over this in order to get to the gist of our instruction sessions. But by taking the time to share with students and let them get to know you, students are more likely to approach you later on when they need more in-depth help or a refresher about the basics. They also noted that taking the time to really introduce yourself can help get rid of some of the apathy we encounter when we teach. I Want to Eat Your Brains: Engaging Students with Brain-Based Teaching Strategies—Jennifer Quinlan, St. Cloud State University This session was particularly useful for me, as it dealt primarily with teaching for-credit library research classes. After a short overview of brain-based teaching (use multiple media, be novel, create positive learning environments, encourage reflection and metacognition, etc.), Quinlan shared some of the assignments she uses to engage students in library research. I don’t know if I’ll be able to incorporate them into my class this semester. But in the future, I want to try and have students do things like creating commercials for subject-specific databases and promotional materials for the library. 10 INFORMATION COMMONER Employee Spotlight: Kim Rollins Background: I am originally from Idaho (and am proud to be an “Idaho Spud”), but now live in Pleasant Grove with my husband, Craig (partner at LJ Cooper Capital Management). My daughter, Madison, is 11 just got accepted for Honors Math in junior high—yay! My son, Conor, is 20 and is currently a UVU student. I also have a spoiled French Bulldog named Princess Phoebe Mae Guadalupe (Phoebe). Favorite things about job/UVU: Hands down my favorite thing about working at the UVU Library is interacting with the staff, faculty, and students. Al Gore hadn’t invented the Internet yet when I got out of grad school in 1992, so I have enjoyed keeping up with the rapid, constant changes in the information profession. Education: I have an MLIS and a bachelor’s degree in communications and public relations from BYU. Favorite Things to Do in My Spare Time: Yoga, Pilates, travelling, and volunteering at my daughter’s school. More About Me: I am thrilled for the opportunity to be back at the UVU Library part-time. I worked in the Library as the Public Services Librarian and Assistant Director from 1991-2007, then went home to spend more time with my family. I have taught CLSS 1050 online since 2009. I am also currently the Public Affairs Coordinator for the Utah Academic Library Consortium, which I have enjoyed doing since 2009. BRAG BOX Congratulations, Sarah! Sarah had her baby three weeks early. She will be working part-time this summer after taking maternity leave. Right now, she plans to work 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM when she returns.

Information Commoner: Keeping Library Staff on Common Ground, September 2013, Volume 8, Issue 1; Information Commoner Announcements In this Issue Mike’s Message 2 New Employee Spotlight 2 At Your Service 3 Department News 3 What’s Our Policy? 4 New Employee Spotlight 9 New Library Aides 12 Volume 8, Issue 1 September 2013 Archives at UVU Alumni Family Fun Fair The Sutherland Archives will have a table at UVU’s annual Alumni Family Fun Fair this Saturday, Septem-ber 28. There will be a prize wheel, giveaways, and—of course—materials from the speciall collections on display. Frida Kahlo Display There is a display of artworks by Frida Kahlo and her contemporaries on display on the fifth floor. The exhibit is sponsered by UVU’s School of the Arts, Artes de Mexico en Utah, Art Works - arts.gov, Utah Divi-sion of Arts & Museums, Utah Humanities Council, Latinos in Action, and El Semanal. The exhibit will be on display through October 17. Fall Break Hours The Library will be open limited hours between October 10-12. We will be open 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Nor-mal hours resume October 14. Extended Reference Hours The Reference Department has extended service hours on Fridays. We will now offer research help until 6:00 PM. Mike’s Message Whenever we have something that we are good at—something we care about—that experience and passion fundamentally change the nature of our first impressions. Malcolm Gladwell, Blink Have you ever been ignored while shopping and looking about for someone to answer your question? How many stores can you name where a friendly face asked you if they could help? (Home Depot comes to mind for me.) Increasingly, we are in the business of selling the Library and its services to faculty and students, competing for our budgetary dollars against a host of other UVU services. If a student walks into the Library and is met with a bunch of faces engrossed in a com-puter screen, or a group of Library staff more interested in their conversation, what do you suppose is that patron’s impression of the Library? In an age of seemingly alterna-tive information sources, what motivates a student to perceive the Library as the place to go? Everyone of us needs to make a marked effort to lift up our eyes, engage patrons coming through the gate, and be aware of that befuddled look we all know so well. A student who walks away to get answers elsewhere is a student we have lost, perhaps forever. On the other hand, a student who gets a friendly and informed answer will return again and again. Marketing the Library as a place of research and service needs to be a top priority. Background Information: I grew up overseas until elementary school, when my parents fell for the lovely people of South Dakota and never left. I came out to Utah for college, fell for the lovely hikes and mountain biking and never left. Education: I did my BA in anthropology at BYU and am applying to grad schools for an MLS. Favorite Things: Knitting, crosswords, read-ing, music, baking (current quest is perfect pie crusts). I’m getting my golden years in early so I can be a free running, drag boat racing grandma later on. Anything else? I’m very excited to be part of the Circulation Department and help to help out wherever I might be useful in the Library. 2 Employee Spotlight: Olivia Wilkinson By Lesli Baker Did you know that our customers gain their first impression of the Library based on the commu-nication skills of the first person they come into contact with? As the saying goes, we only have one chance to make a good first impression. That first impression will influence a student’s future impressions. Great service will bring our students and faculty back for more. Advanced Connections offers some tips that will put some extra polish on our service interactions. One of the tips is to make sure that what you say has a friendly and helpful tone. For example: Average Communication Advanced Communication “Yes?” “How may I help you?” “You’re welcome. “You’re quite welcome. I’m happy to help!” “Yes, I remember you.” “Sure, I remember you. It’s good to see you again!” Remember, your communication skills advertise our service attitude and abilities. Make sure you are sending the right message! 3 At Your Service News from Technical Services By Keith Rowley In the new fiscal year, credit card ordering for videos and rush orders started July 9. Regular book orders resumed August 26. In the short time since ordering started, we have already paid or encumbered over $40,000, or about 20% of this year’s acquisitions budget. This is a really great beginning to this year’s cycle. Cataloging has been busy with a nice supply of new books and videos to catalog. The catalogers have had a fun time watching the prog-ress of the new classroom building. MARC records for our first streaming video package, Films on Demand (see “News from Media” for details), have recently been downloaded into Symphony. 12,332 streaming vid-eos from Films on Demand are now accessible through the online catalog. Check them out! 4 What’s Our Policy? By Lesli Baker We are hearing more and more on campus about service animals, and we all need to be aware of the laws surrounding these animals. The following paragraphs are exerpted from ADA 2010 Revised Requirements: Service Animals (www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010. htm). Service animals are defined as “dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabili-ties. Examples...include guiding people who are blind, alert-ing people who are deaf, pulling a wheelchair, alerting and protecting someone who is having a seizure, reminding a person with mental illness to take prescribed medications, calming a person with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during an anxiety attack, or performing other duties. Service animals are working animals, not pets. The work or task a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person’s disability. Dogs whose sole function is to com-fort or provide emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA.” “Under the ADA, state and local governments, businesses, and nonprofit organizations that serve the public generally must allow service animals to accompany people with disabilities in all areas of the facility where the public is allowed to go.” “When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. Staff may ask two questions [emphasis added]: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. Staff cannot ask about the person’s disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task.” “Allergies and fear of dogs are not valid reasons for denying access or refusing service to people using service dogs. When a person who is allergic to dog dander and a person who uses a service animal must spend time in the same room or facility, for example, in a school classroom or at a homeless shelter, they both should be accommodated by assigning them, if possible, to different locations within the room or different rooms in the facility.” “A person with a disability cannot be asked to remove his service animal from the premises unless: (1) the dog is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it or (2) the dog is not housebroken. When there is a legitimate reason to ask that a service animal be removed, staff must offer the person with the disability the opportunity to obtain goods or services without the animals presence.” 5 By Kim Rollins I’m excited for my new responsiblity of overseeing Access Services and am quickly seeing all of the fantastic things our frontline staff does each day to make our users’ experiences with the Library positive. Here are some of the things we’ve been working on: • An elaborate training system for new aides that involves training sessions, scripts of topics, and an online training checklist. • An electronic form anyone on the library staff can use to request help with a library project from the library aides. The supervisors will see that it gets done. • Set work times at the service desk for the circulation supervisors, similar to the refer-ence desk schedule, that increases quality transations and efficient use of our aides. • Reviewing Access Services information on the Library’s website, with input from the current library aides. • Possible improvements in textbook access in the online catalog. • Creating a cleaning station in the Family Study Room. • RFID tagging for reference books. Lasca has been missed on the team and on the front lines. Everyone has jumped in to cover extra hours. We are finishing up the most chaotic part of the semester with hiring, scheduling, and training and look forward to a productive, service-oriented semester. If you have any suggestions concerning Access Services, please let me know!

The new server’s processing power is roughly four times that of the old server (considering CPU processing power and RAM), and it has massive amounts of disk space available (immedi-ately or augmentable). Currently we are working patiently with OCLC to resolve significant errors in the web interface. EAD finding aids also must be refitted to function on the new server. You can peek at the current appearance of the new 6.4 interface (http://content-dm. uvu.edu), which is readily customizable to suit our Archives’ requirements and tastes. All customizations to version 6.4 are automatically supported by OCLC, so our local retrofitting of customizations is eliminated—a win-win situation for everyone. Computer Updates By Carlos Alarco During the summer, the Library replaced its aging equip-ment in the second floor instruction labs. There are 30 new Lenovo all-in-one computers in LI 207 and 27 in LI 206. These computers run Windows 7. The iMacs in LI 205 have been replaced. The new iMacs run Windows 7 and Mac OSX. The podiums have also been improved with a new con-sole program and monitors, as well as new quiet com-puters. These changes will make teaching in those rooms more efficient and pleasant. 7 News from Electronic Reserves By Alan Stephens Video streaming on ERES continues to grow. I have added 85 videos to the system since the beginning of August, and I have another 20 in process as I am writing this. The reference computer, instruction labs, and info pods have all been upgraded to Inter-net Explorer 10, which will cause some difficulties with ERES. To open articles or videos in IE 10, you will have to set the browser to compatibility view. There are a couple of ways to do this: 1. Use the torn paper icon in the browser’s address bar. Click to turn the icon blue for compatibility view. 2. If the icon is not visible, open the Menu or Command Bar and click Tools. Select com-patibility mode. You also have the option of using Firefox. With a new school year upon us, I thought it would be a good idea to review the password formats for Electronic Reserves. There are two type of passwords on ERES: course pass-words and video/document passwords. The basic course password is used for the majority of ERES pages. The basic format is the instructor’s last name followed by the department abbreviation and course number, all in lower case. For instructors with hyphenated last names, just use the portion of the name before the hyphen. Examples: • The password for Archaeology 1100, taught by Alex Stecker, would be steckerarch1100. • For Anthropology 107G, taught by Gwen Anderson, the password would be andersonanth107g. • And, finally, the password for Angie Banchero-Kelleher’s Dance 4150 class would be bancherodanc4150. Videos do not follow this pattern. Most of the videos on ERES, as well as a handful of documents, have their own passwords. For a student to access one of them, he or she will need to have the course password and the password for the item. Students must get the video and document passwords from their instructors. The nursing videos are a special case. Due to licensing agreements, students may only get the course password for the nursing video from their instructors. If students ask for the password for the Tay-lor Skills or Obstetrical Nursing videos, tell them that they will need to talk to their instructor. News from Media By Trevor Young Media has been very focused on completing two tasks. In April, we began applying RFID tags to the entire video collection. Heather worked very hard and very fast and just last week completed the task. She applied each of the 17,000 tags herself. It’s impressive that she completed a task of such magnitude, especially considering how step-intensive the process was. To apply tags, the liner needed to be completely removed before the tag could be placed, then reinserted into the case. Thanks to her efforts, the video collection can now reap the benefits of the inventory device used to keep track of the book collec-tions. In the summer issue, I reported on our exploration of various streaming packages. We had originally decided to go with VAST, Alexander Street Press’ package. The content and fea-tures were fine, but the price was more attractive. What we really wanted, but couldn’t afford, was Films on Demand (FOD), by the Films Media Group. After some tough negotiations and scrambling to secure extra funds, we were able to subscribe to our favorite collec-tion. That subscription is now in place, giving us access to over 12,000 premium films, mostly produced by Films in the Humanities and Sciences. They can easily be found in our catalog or on FOD’s site and streamed at home, on campus, or in classrooms. Films on Demand is also available from the Library’s com-plete list of databases: www.uvu.edu/library/libsearch/alldatabases.html. Further, all FOD films come with public performance rights, which means they could even be used for a campus screening. I want to point out that evaluating the content of streaming platforms is an extremely daunting task. I relied heavily on Heather to watch countless films across many platforms to get a sense of quality. Thanks, Heather! 8 EDITORIAL INFORMATION The Information Commoner is an internal communication tool published once a month by and for the Utah Valley University Library staff. Input from all library staff is encouraged. The deadline for information submittal is the third Friday of each month. Send information to Lesli Baker via email. 9 News from Reference/Instruction By Annie Smith There have been a few changes in the Reference/Instruction department during the last couple of months. On top of the usual inundation of new and returning students at the reference desk, we have also had some changes to librarian duties. Kim has taken over Jacques’ position as Access Services Librarian. Jacques is now a Collection Management Librarian, overseeing our distance education services and collection analysis. Jacques has also taken over Catherine’s collection areas, to free up more of her time for Archives proj-ects and tasks. Any in-depth research questions about history or political science should go Jacques, as well as suggestions for books in those subject areas. You may have noticed our other change in the Announcements section of this issue. We received feedback from the Circulation Department that they were getting lots of refer-ence- type questions from students after 5:00 PM on Fridays. So we extended our service hours on Friday to 6:00 PM. I collect reference statistics (and have for about three years now), and I plan to review the numbers to see if there are times when we need to add or subtract reference hours. We want to be sure that a librarian is available when students need help with their research. But there are only so many librarians (and willing circulation supervisors), and we need to make sure that we’re making the best use of everyone’s time. The new reference hours are: Monday—Thursday 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM Friday 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM Saturday 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM Employee Spotlight: Jandy Jorgensen Background Information: I am from Pleasant Grove. I still live there, Education: I received my undergraduate degree right here at UVU. I majored in English literature. I am currently working on my Master’s degree in library science from the University of Alabama. Favorite Things: I enjoy dancing, swimming, read-ing, and spending time outdoors camping and four-wheeling. Anything else? I love Café Rio and Diet Coke. My favorite color is pink. I am getting mar-ried on October 10. News from the George Sutherland Archives 10 By Catherine McIntyre Archives will have a table at the Alumni Family Fun Fair on September 28. Aimee will be staffing it. There will be a display of Archives materials, a prize wheel, giveaways, and treats. October is National Archives Month and we have two displays planned in celebration. One exhibit will feature unique items we have in the UVU Archives and Special Collec-tions. The second, a one-day only exhibit, is a special loan from BYU’s L. Tom Perry Special Collections: two volumes of Saint John’s Bible. The exhibit is on October 17. The volumes are volume one (Pentateuch) and seven (Letters and Revelation). According to Wikipedia, Saint John’s Bible is the first completely handwritten and illuminated bible commissioned by a Benedictine abbey since the inven-tion of the printing press. It was officially commissioned in 1998 and completed in December 2011. Saint John’s Bible is divided into seven volumes and is two feet tall by three feet wide when open. The Bible is made of vellum with 160 il-luminations. According to Abbot John Klassen, it cost an estimated $8 million to produce. Please remember the date and time, October 17, 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, and stop by the Archives for this rare opportunity. We’ve had a special visitor to the Archives, T.W. “Bill” Ireland from Indian Wells, California, who found a treasure trove of information about his family in our Archives! Almost a year ago, while doing Google searches on family names, Ireland found the finding aid for the Steve Zolman Collection of John Varah Long Family Materials. The collection included pa-pers regarding the family of Thaddeus Ireland, his great-grandfather! We sent him scanned copies of docments, but he wanted to see them in person. Ireland visited us on September 16 and 17. The papers answered questions he wasn’t able to find answers to elsewhere, even at the Utah State Archives and historical societies and archives in Maine! This is a testament to the value of online searchable finding aids. Yay for Aimee and EAD! We have another new collection. Utah Valley Regional Medical Center donated a large collection of photographs and news clippings ranging from the 1960s through the 1980s. Many of the photos show various buildings in the hospital’s history. Continued on next page. Utah Valley Hospital, c. 1960 Saint John’s Bible, 2011 11 Continued from previous page. Digitization News We have been partici-pating in a statewide digitization projct called, “Pioneers in Your Attic: Preserving the Legacy of the Western Overland Migration.” All of Utah’s universities are partner-ing with public libraries, museums, historical societies, and other groups to set up free scanning events throughout Utah. We are working with Utah, Wasatch, and Millard counties. We schedule a scanning event in a town’s library, then invite the public to bring in any original family diaries, letters, photos, journals, drawings, business papers, etc., that were created between 1840 and 1890. We will scan them for free, send the owner a digital copy, and add the digital images to a free online database in the Mountain West Digital Library. It’s a great way for people to share their family treasures with researchers. So far, Brent and I have beeen to libraries in Provo, Pleasant Grove, Heber City, and Delta. We have to following events scheduled: Orem Public Library October 8 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM Millard High School October 12 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM Spanish Fork Library October 17 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM Springville Public Library October 19 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM This has been a great opportunity to connect with family history centers, historical societ-ies, DUP camps, senior citizens centers, and libraries in these towns and surrounding areas. We will also scan materials in the Archives and go to people’s homes if they cannot make it to the events. I hope you will spread the word about this unique opportunity—tell your family, friends, and neighbors. The project website is http://mwdl.org/portals/pioneers. php. We also completed a big digitization project, thanks to an LSTA grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the Utah State Library. We gathered the historic run of the student newspaper, from one issue printed in 1966 (the UTTI Scope) through the UVU Review, December 2012. The digital collection is online at http://contentdm.uvu.edu/cdm/ landingpage/collection/trades. We upgraded to a newer version of ContentDM, version 6.4, so there are some differences in the displays of the collections. We also moved to a new server. So many thanks to Mark Stevens for seeing those two big migrations through and for troubleshooting problems and trying to work with ContentDM support. There are still a few glitches. If you run across problems accessing anything, please let me know and we will try to address it. 12 Written by themselves I am Asha Verma. I am from India. My major is computer science.

To the Board of Control of the Jllevada A,r/ticultu,ral E.rper£rnent Station: (h:XTLE~lEN: I have the honor to sulnuit herewith lny report as Director of the Experiment Station for the year ended Decclnber :31, 1892: - The station staff remains the san1e as one year ago, with one exception. Last August, Mr. H. P. Brown, foreman of the farm, ~uverec1 his connection with the Station, and Mr. R. A. Lounsbury of the Colorado Agricultural College was ,employed as foreman in his place. "Nil'. Ijounshnry has long been engaged in experinwntal work and is a very efficient man for the position. . l\feetings of the staff have been regularly held on the second Sat­l11' clay of each month throughout the year. At these meetings n~p0I'ts have been made on the experiments in operation, future experiments outline(l, the publication of bulletins and articles from newspapers considered, and the general work and efficiency of the tltntioll discussed. The three departments of Agriculture and IIorticlllture, ChC1ll­istry and Entomology and Botany made very creditable exhibits at the State Fair in Reno, the Agricultural District Fair in Carson City, and the Chemist made all exhibit of dairy apparatus at the Sierraville, California, Fail'. All of these departlnents attracted a good deal of attention. It is the intention another season to exhibit at a still greater Humbel' of fairs, and thus endeavor to bring the work of the Station into even closer relations with the people of the State. Preparations are being made for a small but representative ex­hibit at tlw vVorId's Fail'. Fifteen salnples of soil taken in different eOl1nties of the State are now in readiness; also varieties of grain and grasses. Something is also being done by the EntOIllologist and Botanist in that dil'edion. Photographs of the Station build­ing, laboratories, library, farm, etc. , have been prepared for that purpose. :Meteorological observations have been regularly taken at the EXPEHDIENT STA'l'IO~. 5 Station at 7 A. ~I., 2 P. ~I. and D P. ~I., a record kept, and at the end of each lnonth a report sent to the State Observer at Carson Cit". 'huee bulletins have been issued during the year, as follows: No. 1o, "Cremnery Industry;" No. 17, "\Voolly Aphis," and No. 18, "Cheese and its ~lanufncture." 'rhe fourth, No. 1D, on "Sugar Beets," is shortly to be issued .. Quite a llUlnber of books, periodicals and pamphlets have been aclded to the library, which, though small, has been carefully selected, and is well adapted to its purpose. Owing to the small llulnber and crowderl condition of the farm huilding~, some of the wagons, carts, tools, impleuwnts, etc., are not properly honsed. I would, therefore, recommend the erection of a suostan tial but inexpensi \'0 building for their protection. It ~Cl\mS to me that the time is fast approaching, if not already here, when a series of farmers' institntes, held during the months of December, January and February, would be of great service in ad \'ancing the interests of agriculture, and ill brillgiug the farming eommunity of this State into closer touch with the Station :md to a hl\tter apP~'ecintiol1 of its \rork. I desire to call the attention of the BunnI of Control to this matter, and to suggest that arrangements 1)l' Illnde for carrying out this plan. A number of newspaper bulletins on subjects of vital interest IIHYC, fl\)!ll time to time, appeared in all the ne\rspapers of the State, and in this connection we desire to express our obligations to the press for the kindness and courtesy in publishing these, as well as other matters. The following reports of the different members of the staff give specific information in regard to their departments. Hespectfully submitted, STEPIIEN A. .JONES, Director.

Ib the Director: SIR: or have the honor to submit the following report as indicating the main features of the work for 1R92. The area used was largely the same as that selected for field experiments last season, with a slight increase due to the use of the hillside east of the orchard for raspberries and currants, and by planting a portion of the garden crop between the rows of young apple trees. The quarter-acre list of plats was increased with I and .J using ground occupied with Fall grain in 1891. The iron stakes put at the corners, established by the 11ining Departrnent to maintain plat boundary lines in the sante position from year to year, are proving to be the right stakes in the right plaee. 1'ho plats used for field experilnents were fairly Inanured except No.7, planted to potatoes, plowed the latter part of February, and well fitted for seeding by the thorough use of harrow and roller. Different Amounts of Seed Wheat. yable No. 1 gives the results of a continuation of the tests of tluck and thin seeding, using quarter acres B, C, D and E, which w~rc planted to sugar beots in 1891.

The proscnl'e of this odor, which has gi ve-n rise to tl~o common name, is a "ery g(}()(l test for the presence of the smut.

Summary. 1. The ~oss to l\lichigan this year in the oat crop alone, caused by smut, 'nIl be $1,000,000, and this is a very ]ow estimnte. 2. The Slllllt of oats and the stinking smut of \dlcat are parasitic plants. :3. 'l'lle spores of these smuts attach thcnlselves to the kernels of oats or wheat and are sown with them. -1:. The spores gerlninatc at about the same time the seed germinates, anel, in SOlne way, enter the young plant and live upon it until, finnlly, the head of the smut appears. ,5. Both of these Sllluts ean be entirely IH'e\Tented at a slight expense by the .Jenson or hot water treatml~nt. n. The \rater should be about 1:3.5° "'hen the seed is put in and not allowe(1 to fa 1] below 1~30°. Hemove the seed at the end of five minutes. 7. Professors Jellsen, Swingle, Kellerman, .£\ l'thur, and others, lIave found that u this treatment not onlv re­moves the smut from the crop, but in11)l'oves the growth ~ and increases the yield." 8. The increased yield is sufficient to pay for the labor and trouble of treatment several tillIes over. H. Do not conclude that vou have no smut because vou do not sec it. In the case of Oilts tl~e smut is mostly blown ~ff before harvest, anel the sm nttec1 stalks, being shorter than the healthy ones, are not ob~erved. 10. \Vbat the farmers of .\Tichig XEVADA AGRICULTURAL visiting an oatmeal plant in Chicago the wl'itl?l' was told by tho Superintendent that' they used 8,000 Lusbels daily of the best ordinary oats to be obtained, largely for rolled oats. That for somo reasons the Hulless would be bettor than the orc1irU1T\' oats, but in growing the 1-1ulless should be kept entirely sepm~ate frOlll the ordinary kinds. 'To some parts of the mill the visitor is not shown. Barley. Notes on seven varieties of barley are given in Table No.5.

'rhe growth of the grain this season suggests the question, in tinles of necessity l'Hn H paying crop be grown with three well-tilned irrigations '! Some States use from one to three irrigations, the rainfall being from fonr to four and one-half inches for April and :May, and the grain stalHling ten to fifteen inches high when the water is turned on the fir:-.:t time. Each irrigation costs the farmer cash, not only for water, but for labor to apply it. Corn. For field yaricties a trial was made of the Pride of the North, Leaming and Chester County w[anllnoth Dent. The first named is a medi UIll sized yellow dent, but of sufficiently rapid growth to ripen at this altitude or even four hundred higher. One-sixteenth of an acre (If this yariety was grown, yielding 205 pounds. 11his was planted :\[ay 24th and ripened S8ptelnbor 17th, The height of the best stalks was eight feet one inch. The Lenming is a fair sized field variety (seed frOlu Cox, San Francisco), which grow to a height of nine feet one inch, with ears ready for table use September 2d. 'rhe planting -was done June 3d, but it did not fully ripen. Chester County ~Iammoth Dent is rank in growth, the stalks growillg to a height of ten feet and twelve feet in some localities in the East. This was planted lVlay 31st and ripened one ear. It seems rather large for this section, but it may be possible to so lnmwge th8 culture as to secure a medimll crop.

For a trial of varieties the list given in rrabl"e No. 9 was grown. Tboso nUlnbers from. 1 to 9 were taken frOln the hot bed and planted in the open ground from :May 27th to 31st. The spring was eool and it se81l1ed of doubtful advantage to put thOln out e,adier. The order of naming in the table is according to yield with numbers frOlu 1 to 9. The others were necessarily planted late, and for this reason not compared in yield with those ()f lVIay 27th. The tree tOlnato is tho largest in growth of vine and fruit. The latter is somewhat irregular in outline and quite large. Some samples weighed nearly one pound. The first to ripen were r.rrophy and Livingston's Perfection, on August 21st. The other varieties were several days later, the Brandywine September 24th, aud ~ Dwarf Champion, PeaelL---'rhe seed was obtained frOlll ~lr. Ross Lewers. of Ij'ranIttown. It resembles a Inedium sized peach. All who have given it a trial speak well of its quality. Its convenient size for household purposes has been especially recomlnendec1. Dwarf Champion with some is a favorite and ranks first in quality. 1'he fruit is symmetrical, nearly round, and it keeps fresh a nUlnber of weeks. The plants present quite a contrast to all others and are short and compaet. The fruit is in close clusters~ and the foliage dark green, quite thick and corrugated. Some prelilninarynotes have beon tn ken on the lasting qualities of the different varieties. rrhe Yellow Plum seemed to possess this quality in a greater degree than any other grown this season.

Of this forage phuit, which is fed to horses in SOlne parts of Europe, and to cattle with sonle care after the pods have fonned, one­fortieth of an acre was grown. The cutting was not dOlle until late. Hepcnted and sharp frosts made very little change in its appearance; the growth was quite strong. One hundred and twenty-nine pounds 8 ouuces .were harvested, or at the rate of 6,180 pounds per acre. Sugar Beets. The details of the work with sugar beets are given in Bulletin Xo. 19. One shipment was lnude to Dr. \Viley, Chiof Chemist of the Department of Agriculture, who says in a lettor: " III respon~e to your conllnunication bearing date of November 11, I take pleas­ure in s,aying that your beets are excellent in shape, although SfJIUO­what small, and are extremely good as far as sugar contents go, as you lnay see fr01n the report sent under separate cover." In regard to size, the largest beets were avoided in lnnking up the shipment for Dr. \Viley. As a general rule with well bred seed on good land~ the size of sugar beets will be practically regulated by the distance between the rows, and especially the distance between plants in the row.

To the Director of the JVcl'ada Agricultw'al ]/}rperirncnt Station: SIR: It is my pleasure to submit herewith the report of the De­partment of Chemistry for the year ending Decembel' :31, 1892. The work of this depnrtlnent the past year has be(~n of a quite general nature. T'he various lines which have reeeivec1 attention are: The analyses of forage crops, analyses of bOlne raised tobacco, dairy products, fertilizers and fertilizing lnaterial, drinking waters, sorghum, sugar beets and soils. Special attention has been given to dairy work, and the necessity and importance of lnilk testing has been repeatedly Drought to the attention of the f~Hmers of the State, and very encouraging results have, been attained. III April, Bulletin No. lG, II Cn..'aJnery Industry," was issued, treating in full the Stl bject of butter making. The demand for siln­ilar infonnation concerning cheese Inanufactnre seemed to warrant the publication of a separate bulletin on that subject, and during DeceInber Bulletin No. 18, "Cheese and Its l\lunufacture," appeared. At the Nevada State J1"'air held at Heno, September 19 to 24, in­clusive, we exhibited a working laboratory fitted complete for testing dairy products and sngar beets. I was greatly aided in this work by ~Ir. Frederick Stacltllluller, Assistant in Chernistry in the Uni­versity, who kindly offered his services. This exhibit attracted a great deal of attention, and the explana­tion of the different processes was listened to with interest. The ex hibit was aftenrards taken to Carson City and shown at the District Fair, "'here it also excited a great deal of inter-ost. By request of the Directors of the Eleventh District, California Fair, we exhibited also at Sierraville, October :3d to 6th inclusive, where the milk testing apparatus was highly appreciated, the f~trJners bringing twenty-five smnples to be tt'steel on one occasion. As the dairy interests of the State are ac1nuwing rapidly, and recognizing the great benefits to be derived by the farnler fr01n carefully testing his herd, and by the cremnory man in paying for his raw material and controlling his losses in separator and churn, by the nse of the tester, I would recomnlend that steps be taken to visit as Inany of the District Fairs of this State another fall as possible, in order to exhibit and explain the process of milk testing and its importance from a com­mercial standpoint. XEVADA ~HjHICUL'l'URAL Tho sugar beet exporiments of last year haY8 been continued and til{' result of tho analysis of sanlplcs from the Station fanIl, and f'rom the State at large, arc now under way.

THE RELATION OF THE EXPERIMENT STATION TO THE AGRI­CULTURAL COLLEGE AND TO UNIVERSITY EXTENSION By SAMUEL B. DOTEN, Director Where education touches the industry of agriculture there are three great fields of work very closely related, each of fundamental impor­tance to the others, but distinct enough in fact so that it is wise to separate them distinctly in our minds. The first of these three great fields of work and thought is the work of the agricultural experiment stations. This is first, because we must get our facts before we can teach them; and it is out of experimental work that we must gain our new facts, and our understanding of the principles beneath the old and well-known facts.' The second great field of work and thought in agricultural education is the teaching course of the agricultural colleges. It is of no use to have facts and principles relating to agriculture, facts and principles derived from observation and experiment unless these facts are to come--2--into the possession of each generation of farmers. But we have so much information at hand, we have farmed through so many generations in so many countries, and through so many thousands of years, that there is a great body of fact and principles which we get by inheritance. Even in the time of the Romans, much that we know now and teach continually, both on the farm itself and in the agricultural colleges, was 'well known and ,,'as recorded in Latin literature. But in the last hundred years there has grown up a great body of fact and principle which is derived from a great variety of sciences. We have tried and tested and studied the things that go on in the fields, and have worked out new things and new methods, until, to the body of fact and prin­ciple inherited from our ancestors, we have added a host of new things derived from nothing but careful experimental work and investigation. The new facts are so numerous and of such importance, principles underlying old and new alike are so vital, that the only way in which they may be presented clearly and completely is in a college course running through several years. Such a course fits a young man for knowledge of what he is doing on the farm, for an ever-growing interest in his work, and for leadership in his farm community. The third great field is the field of university extension. Here we aim not to get new principles and methods, not to teach the whole set of things known in a complete and thorough way, but rather to give to the farmer himself some immediate help toward better and more successful farming. This appeals directly to the farmer himself and interests him often more and more vitally than either the experimental work or the ,vork of the classrooms in the agricultural college. Now, we said in the beginning of this article that it is important to get a clear idea of the differences between the experiment station work and the work of the agricultural college, and work in extension. They are so important that this issue of BETTER FARMING aims simply to set forth these differences and the reasons underlying them. We are right now at the beginning of a new· era in the University of Nevada when we are coming into our own, and when the University is, beginning the most successful and prosperous and mature portion of its existence. Let ns no longer confuse our fields of thought and work. THE EXPERIMENT STATION The foundation of the American Agricultural Experiment Stations began with the passage of the Hatch Act in 1887. This Act states the purposes '\vhich it has in view in the following terms: rrhat it "shall be the duty of said experiment stations to conduct original researches or verify experiments on the physiology of plants and animals; the diseases to which they are severally subject, with the remedies for the same; the chemical composition of useful plants at their different stages of growth; the comparative advantages of rotative cropping as pursued under the varying series of crops; the capacity of new plants or trees for acclimation; the analysis of soils and water; the chemical composition of manures, natural or artificial, with experiments designed to test the comparative effects on crops of different kinds; the adaptation and value of grasses and forage plants; the composition and digestibility of the different kinds of food for domestic animals; the scientific and economic questions involved in the production of butter and cheese; and such other researches or experiments bearing -3- directly on the agricultural industry of the United States as may in each case be deemed advisable, having due regard for the varying con­ditions and needs of the respective States and Territories." The language quoted is very general, and can be so interpreted that it "'ill cover a host of unrelated things; but in the center of the plans and purposes we see the one vital thing: that the purpose of the experi­ment station is to find out new facts and principles rather than to teach the old and well-known facts and principles either in the class­room or in the field. To find out, to discover, to make advances! 'fo gain new ideas and new facts, and new interpretations of old and well-known things, to bring light-this is the central, the permanent idea and ideal that underlies the work of the Experiment Station. ,The farmer cannot afford to experiment; he must do what he has every reason to know ,vill come out welL I-Ie must follow the old beaten track of experience and tradition. Just as surely as he begins to experiment, unless he be trained in scientific accuracy of methods and observations, he gets into great danger of heavy financial loss. There is no class of people in America or in any other country who . on the whole are so conservative as the farmers. They have to be con­servative. They must be skeptical of new things. So, in politics, in religion, in home life, the farmers on the whole must change slowly. As a class they are the very salvation of the country in times of mental and moral disorder. They cannot try rash experiments; they must stick tight to things proven to be safe and good. But, all the same, there is need of experiment. There is continual need of testing and trying new things and new methods and new ideas. There is on every side a promise of progress. Perhaps, if we change our methods of irrigating, of planting, of spraying, or of breeding, we shall get better things; better and heavier crops of grain, or more alfalfa with less water. Perhaps here in our own State of Nevada we may be able to make our limited water supply give us far larger acreages of alfalfa if we experiment with methods of irrigating and cultivation and the like. Still this is all a matter for the most careful and patient investigation through many, many years. And no farmer is usually able to experiment with his living through many, many years. Experiments are far too apt to be failures. In ,fact, it is the law of change, of experiment, that almost all the trials made will be failures, or partial failures. Experimental work is intensely difficult and exceedingly slow to bear fruit on the whole. The need of constant, s~'stematic work is so real and so vital and so widespread that it ought to be undertaken by the State Governments or by the National Govern­ment, and not left to chance and private individuals. Investigation and experiment offer a rich field for work by the General Government. A thing which is of interest to the whole country ought to be under­taken by the National Government; a thing which is of interest to a whole State shohld be undertaken by the State Government. So, with experiment and investigation relating to agricultural work, it is emi­nentl~ r suitable that the expense of the work be borne by the whole people, and supported by national taxation. No man can work out a method of irrigation which gives improved results in Nevada without having solved problems for irrigators in Colorado, in Utah, and all through western America. No experimenter can work out methods of spraying apple trees infested with scale insects in California without -4- solving problems for orchardists in Illinois, in New York, and in all the parts of the world where apples are grown. Every real experiment is of interest to the Nation, and oftentimes to the world. So the experimental work of each of the States becomes a thing of national interest, or of interest to the whole world. If a man in France makes a careful series of experiments on the pruning of grape-vines which tells him when and how they ought to be pruned to give the heaviest yields, then his experiments are of real interest in California. Experi­mental work is of too great interest, and of too vital importance, to be anything less than a matter to be cherished and encouraged by the. whole Nation. So. with this view in mind, the I-Iatch Act was passed in 1887 and it becomes the foundation of a national system of Experiment Stations. After some years it became very evident that the progress had 'been so great and the work of the Experiment Stations so fruitful that it would be wiser to grant far larger sums of federal money for their support. In 1906 the Adams Act was passed establishing a fund increasing . annually until 1911, when it became equal to the Hatch Fund. Each station now receives the sum of $30,000 of federal money; and most of the State Governments make heavy additional appropriations for the support of the work. The work seems highly expensive and very slow to bear fruit on the whole. A man who is to make studies of the chemistry of any growing crop to determine just what is its chemical constitution at various stages of its growth must have had many years' training in the best universi­ties before he is in a position to work out new information on this sub­ject. The man who is to work out means for controlling a new insect pest must have had years of training in the study of insect-life. And the man who is to add to our knowledge of methods of irrigation, of methods of cultivation which will keep the water in the soil, must have back of him years of life on the farm, years of life in college, and yearR of experience in the field. He should have the point of view of the farmer, the training of the engineer, and the genius of the born experi­menter. Such men are rare; for out of ten men well trained in the best colleges, it is usually hard to find a single one who has the peculiar type of mind which will fit him to work patiently and thoroughly until he has worked out something new. We have now an agricultural experiment station in every State of the Union. It is their purpose to find out explanations of things old and well known, to find out llew applications of settled facts and well­known principles, and discover new principles and methods. We should not confuse with other things this vital work, this work on the frontier of knowledge, this thing which looks always forward, working con­tinually for progress, this work of experiment and investigation which is the field of the experiment station. THE AGRIOULTURAL OOLLEGE The work of the Agricultural College is different from that of the Experiment Station. The experimenter finds out things, discovers things; the teacher presents them to the next generation. The experi­menter may be no teacher at all. The teacher may be very unsuccessful as an investigator. Neither can get along without the other. It is not 5 of much use to discover facts and principles if they are not then to be tanght. We need the investigator to give us information. We need the teacher to keep the information as a part of our heritage. The experimenter must concentrate his whole mind and soul on some little point of knowledge until right there he can 'work out something new. It will look of vast importance to him. It represents so much effort, it stands for so much of his own best self, that it cannot help but appear vitally important. But, to the teacher looking over the whole field of knowledge in his specialty, the new fact is not so isolated and snpreme; it is apt to be more like another link in a chain, another little stream pouring into the ocean of things known. So while the experiment station needs the scientific investigator, needs the man who can bury himself in his laboratory and work at one thing for months, the agricultural college needs quite another type of man­the teacher. Now it is true of the teacher, the real and vital teacher always, that he is interested most deeply and truly in his subject, that he shall love his subject with all his heart and teach it with all his might; but it is even more true of the teacher that he is yet more deeply interested in the students who are his to teach. The investigator, the scientist, may often be somewhat one-sided, something of a "crank." But the teacher must not be that, of all things; he must be preeminently human. The result that he gets with the pnpil is measured by his success in develop­ing another mind. This is the thing of vital interest and importance to the teacher. lIe must work always for others; and the measure of the success of the teacher is not his investigation, not his contribution of something new to the world; it is his effectiveness in giving knowl­edge, and developing character in his pupils. So teachers, men with the good of the coming men and women at heart, have slowly brought together in libraries and in text-books that whole great body of facts and experience which we call agricultural practice. And out of this whole great field they have arranged courses of study which will give the most useful and important portion of this mass of knowledge to the men who are themselves preparing to become farmers or specialists in farm studies. This makes up what is called the College of Agriculture. In the College of Agriculture there is a great variety of courses of stud:r. 'rhere are breeds of animals to be studied, their characteristics, their origin, and values for various purposes or for special purposes. The students in such courses become good judges of stock, and can make excellent judgments of the points of animals which come under their observation. In the buying and selling of various farm animals, in their breeding on the farm, and in raising and handling them, such knowledge is of high importance. It is not experimental, much of it is derived from investigation and experiment; most of it belongs to a great body of knowledge originating in the experience of farmers in many lands for hundreds of years. Then there is the study of field crops, called Agronomy. The charac­teristics of varieties of each of the many crops grown, the methods of growing them to the best advantage, all the various methods of culti­vation, the soils, water, manures, and a host of other topics relating to the production of the best crops at least cost, group themselves naturally -6- around this subject of field crops. It is a thing which can be studied for many years. And it is of immediate and direct practical applica­tion to the farm. Then there is the great subject of the soil with its underlying chemi­cal principles, and its relation to geology; chemistry, in its application to food stuffs and feeding; dairying, with all its special methods and apparatus, and its special type of dairy animals; horticulture, with its great fields of varieties of fruits and methods of handling orchards and fighting the pests which ravage orchard crops. The problem is never that of finding enough facts and principles to make up a course in agriculture, but rather how to select among the great mass of things known, and how to present the things selected in the clearest and most forcible way. Stock judging must be taught largely with the living animals, and these animals, making up the col­lege herd, must be of the best, true to type, and showing the best characteristics of their respective breeds. Otherwise the student can get only a false idea of the breed and its characteristics. This makes it necessary to maintain in every agricultural college a college herd, or college herds, which will give the students fine examples and accurate ideas, and finally, skill in judging the living animal. So, too, there must be a farm for these herds, with suitable barns and buildings, and other farm equipment which will make it possible to handle the animals to the very best advantage. One of the first things which Nevada is going to do for the University in addition to the greatly generous things which she has already done, will be to add largely to the equipment in this most important field. It would be possible to devote far more space to this sketch of the field of work of the agricultural college; but as it is the purpose of this article rather to state the distinctions between three fields of work and thought than to give- in detail the kind of work done and to be done in the three fields, we will summarize here the distinction between the first two fields. The Experiment Station aims to find out new facts and principles bearing on agriculture, and to find new application for facts and principles already known. The Agricultural College teaches in the clearest and most forcible and practical way the things known regarding agriculture. The Federal Government supports the experi­ment stations liberally, and makes generous appropriation for the aid of the agricultural colleges. The States must aid both; but in our own State there is most need for liberal and generous support in farms, live stock, and buildings for the support of the Agricultural College. The State of Nevada should make its department of animal industry correspond in importance and in equipment to the importance of the sheep and cattle industries in the State. UNIVERSITY EXTENSION We have spoken of the two great fields of work and thought in agri­cultural education-experimental investigations and classroom teach­ing. There is a third of equal importance, or of importance and interest constantly growing. That is the field of teaching called Uni­versity Extension. In agriculture it is coming to be called "Agricul­tural Extension." -7- There is no other movement of quite so popular interest and approval at the present time as this movement to extend the influence and the work of the college to the farm itself. l\1uch has been done in the past. So much work in the extension of facts already known has been done by men employed for experimental work and investigation in the Stations that our minds have become confused, until we do not think clearly in regard to the Experiment Stations. We forget that it is the purpose of the station to find ont things new, things that may be taught to the pupils in the classroom or to the farmers in the field. We have all been forgetting that we must have sources of things to be taught and that we must get the first facts before we can either teach them or extend them. Without continual experiments and systematic investigation the teaching in agriculture will resemble the course of a blind horse in a treadmill; doing useful work, but plodding round in the same olel circle with no outlook. Without continual experiment and systematic investigation in the experiment station we can extend the past into the present, but we cannot extend a better present into a nobler future. Extension work which has no solid base of experiment and investiga­tion will come in time to extend an empty hand. So it is of great importance right at the outset to guard the experimental work and investigation, and to guard the men who are doing it against the necessity of classroom teaching and against the popular clamor which would take them from their own field, in which they work well, into other fields for which their habits of mind unfit them and in which they will work to no advantage. Agricultural extension, like experimental work or teaching, requires its own special type of man. He is to meet men in their fields or their homes, not boys in the classroom. It is to be his task, his duty, and his pleasure, to carry to the farmer himself on his farm the faCt or the method which he needs to know. The worker in agricultural exten­sion must be a man of deep and sound and thorough training. His knowledge must be broad as the whole field of, the work of the experi­ment station and the agricultural college. He must be able to see what may be done on any farm and every farm to make conditions -better, and to make the work better and more successful. The agricultural exten­sion worker is a man with a mission. The problem of agricultural extension is how to help the individual farmer, or the farmers of some one group of farms. It is a broad field of work. It links both the experiment station and the agricultural col­lege to the farmer. When the extension workers of the corn-growing States went about in the land showing grown men how to get larger yields of better corn from the same land, they did not meet with recognition until they began to show the boys of the farm, in junior corn clubs, how to select and plant and cultivate larger yields of better corn per acre than their fathers were growing. When the father found his own boy beating him at his own game on his own farm, then the father took notice of the fact that there was a good deal besides preaching in that gospel of corn. It is just this sort of thing, this actual demonstration of things taught in the classroom right out in the field, demonstrations for grown men -8- of long experience, which point out better ways of farming; it is just this sort of thing which makes up the subject-matter of agricultural extension. The State of Nevada has felt the need of extension work in agricul­ture; but there have been no funds from which the work could be done legitimately. The funds for experimental work and investigation, the funds of the Experiment Station, cannot be used for field demonstration work-that is, for extension. Nor can the federal funds for the Agri­cultural Oollege be used for work outside the teaching courses on the University campus. Still, the University of Nevada has really done a good deal of agricultural extension work of a high order. Our depart­ment of animal husbandry has demonstrated the importance of good blood in live stock, a principle known, recognized, but often neglected, and put this principle before the people of the State in a forcible way. This was done by the actual breeding and exhibition of types of animals from the college farm so good that they won dozens of medals and ribbons at the stock shows of the Ooast. As university extension this was a piece of work of a high order; it was not experimental work or investigation; it was putting into concrete form a well-recognized prin­ciple of breeding, and then hammering it home to the individual farmer in the form of actual animals of the highest type. We feel the need of work in agricultural extension; and just when the need is pressing there comes a good prospect of means of getting it. Starting from the premise that whatever will benefit one State will benefit all, the National Government is now planning to give financial aid to agricultural extension work in all the States. There is now pending in Congress a bill introduced in the Senate by Senator Hoke Smith of Georgia, which will provide a sum of $10,000 yearly for this purpose in each State, with annual additions, which must be met by equal amounts provided by the States themselves. The passage of this bill, or of similar legislation, will give Nevada a chance to develop sound and thorough work in agricultural extension with permanency and assured value from the start. The scattered threads of thought in this paper may be brought together into the three lines of activity in agricultural education of which we spoke in the opening paragraph: Experiment Station Work, The Agricultural College, and Agricultural Extension. The first finds out facts, and works for progress; the second systematizes all the facts and brings them into relation and teaches them in the classroom, while the third extends the findings of the stations, and the things taught in the classroom to the man in the field. All are alike necessary. Noone of them can stand alone or progress alone. SUGGESTIONS TO THOSE WISHING AGRICULTURAL LITERATURE Compiled by LOUISE BLANEY, Station Secretar:r There are probably few farmers and rural school workers who realize what a large amount of agricultural publications are to be had from the Department of Agriculture free of charge. The United States, through this department, publishes the greatest amount of literature on agricul­ture and related subjects of any nation, but this has not been entirely effective. A great many requests go to \Vashington, as they come to this Station, for publications, which lack definiteness of title, and no doubt much literature is sent out that does not meet the exact need of the applicant. These suggestions are compiled with the purpose of assisting toward a wider and more definite use of the government publications on agri­cultural subjects by classifying them with reference to subjects of interest to the farmer and those commonly taught in the schools. It is particularly desirable that teachers should be prepared to use these publications to the best advantage, and it is hoped that many teachers "will become acquainted with what the Department offers, and use the opportunity to build up in their schools a substantial, per­manent, agricultural library. The public school library is often the only library that is available for rural communities, so if the rural teacher builds up. an agricultural reference library from the material offered free, the school may in that way be the means, not only of instructing the young, but of bringing to the entire community the very best of modern thought and the advice of agricultural experts. KINDS OF PUBLICATIONS The publications of the U. S. Department of Agriculture are divided into three general classes. The first class are those that are issued annually, such as the Year Book, and the reports of the various bureaus. The second-class publications consist of other departmental reports, bureau bulletins and technical papers. The third class consists of Farmers' Bulletins and other popular material. This compilation will deal with the third class. LISTS ANNOUNCING MATERIAL The Department also publishes a monthly list of their publications, and a monthly list of State Experiment Station publications as they are received from time to time by the Office of Experiment Stations. Anyone who wishes to keep in touch with the new publications of the U. S. Department of Agriculture may do so by requesting the Secretary of Agriculture to place his name on the mailing list to receive the monthly list of publications. Many bulletins of interest and value are published for which a small price is charged-usually not more than 15 centS-being merely the cost of reprinting exhausted editions.

Young, K_OH6_045; The St. Benedict’s School of Nursing was founded in 1947 by the Sisters of Mount Benedict. The school operated from April 1947 to 1968. Over that forty-one year period, the school had 605 students and 357 graduates. In 1966, the program became the basis for Weber State College’s Practical Nurse Program and eventually merged into Weber’s Nursing Program. This oral history project was created to capture the memories of the graduates and to add to the history of nursing education in Ogden. The interviews focus on their training, religion, and experiences working with doctors, nurses, nuns, and patients at St. Benedict’s Hospital. This project received funding from the Utah Humanities Council and the Utah State History.;  .

QUICK MIXES for HIGH-ALTITUDE BAKING By FERNE BOWMAN, Home Economist and ELIZABETH DYAR GIFFORD, Chief Home Economist Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station* T HIS BULLETIN presents recipes for high-altitude mixes and various baked products that can be prepared from them. 'The recipes were standardized and tested in the altitude laboratory of the Home Economics section of the Colorado State University Experiment Station. The bakings at 7,500 and 10,000 feet were conducted in the altitude chamber. ALL-PURPOSE MIXES FOR HIGH ALTITUDES 4. These mixes provide a short cut for preparing a wide variety of baked. goods, Thqse foods include biscuits, muffins, pancakes, waffles, breadsj pastries, cakes, and cookies. 'The recipes were designed to meet present-day needs. Although the mixing procedures differ from the older conventional method of mixing, the rules are simpler, the mixing times are quicker, and the final results are reliable. In repeated tests, the desirability of each food prepared from a MIX was compared with the quality of a similar food combined according to conventional procedures. For such evaluations, four or more home econo-mists of the Experiment Station tasted and judged each food. 'The recipes were rated either good or excellent by these food judges. *The experimental baklnga ware made by Mra. Kathryn Colmey and Mrs. Elizabeth Twornev wlth the technical aaalalanca of Mrs. Elale Slayton. Mias Mlrlam Hurnrnal and Mra. Marlana Kulaa Poor-man gave recipe su~geatlon thus, she can economize and will know that these ingredients are fresh. Through good planning and wise buying she can save money for the family budget and feed her family just as well. The savings, when one prepares a mix in preference to using com-mercial mixes, vary with the kind of baking, way of shopping, and whether home-produced ingredients are used. In general, the saving is from 5 to 25 percent. The savings are greater for the family that produces milk, butter, and eggs. MOW TO INSURE SUCCESS IN BAKING 1. Use recipes tested for your altitude. If the altitude at which you live is not exactly 5,000, 7,500 or 10,000 feet, use the recipes for the nearest altitude. 2. Assemble all ingredients. To obtain best results, all ingredients should be at room temperature. Fats should be soft enough to stir with a spoon. 3. Collect all necessary utensils and equipment. Use the type and size of baking pans specified in the recipe and prepare them according to the directions. Pan size in relation to amount of batter is important. If you have pans smaller than those specified in the cake recipe, fill pans half full and bake remaining batter in muffin pans. 4. Turn on the oven and set the temperature control as specified in each recipe. Be sure oven has reached the desired temperature before put-ting foods in to bake. 5. Measure accurately and level off all measurements. Use standard measuring spoons and standard measuring cups. At high altitudes recipes are more sensitive to slight changes. Follow each recipe carefully and be sure the measurements are exact. 6. Some brands of flour require more liquid than others. To obtain the best results, occasionally slight adjustments in the amount of liquid may be necessary. 7. Use hydrogenated shortenings* in the QUICK MIXES. The short-enings are most suitable for quick methods of mixing and they do not re-quire refrigeration. Hydrogenated shortenings are an aid to successful baking at high altitudes. 8. Press shortening firmly into the measuring spoon or cup. 9. Sift flour, and then spoon it lightly into the measuring cup. 10. Sift sugar if it is lumpy. Pack brown sugar into a cup firmly enough for the sugar to keep the shape when it is turned out. 11. Measure liquids with the cup on a level surface. 12. Select the MIX that is recommended in each recipe. 13. Measure the MIX by spooning it lightly into the cup and level it off. Do not pack it. 14. To test whether a cake is done, press the surface of the cake light-ly. If it springs back it is done. 15. Remove baked products from the oven as soon as they are done. 16. Place baking pans on a wire rack to cool. After they have cooled for a few minutes, remove product from the pan. 'Hydrogenated shortenings ere commercially prepared vegelable olla or enlrnal fala. They are usually packa~ed in the containera and ore so treated thot they do not require refrigerotion. Tilose which have omulaifiera oddad produce cakea hat have batter volume and texture. Brand namea will be furnlahad upon request. MIXES TO BE USED AT HIGH ALTITUDES Formulas for three all-purpose and three cake mixes are given below.

Summary One hundred twenty steer calves (avg. wt. 371 1bs.) were used to measure the effect of two winter supplements and three diethe1stilbestr01 treatments upon subsequent pasture and feedlot performance. carcass quality grade and cutabi1ity score were measured. During the 94 day wintering phase the steers were allotted into two equal groups (I 12 mg. winter plus 12 mg. summer and 12 mg. summer. All steers were fed DES in the feedlot. During the winter, both groups received native hay ad lib.; Group II received a 0.64 kg. per head per day grain supplement. Adequate protein and mineral supplement was fed during all phases. There was no statistically significant difference in any treatment for the 94 day wintering phase. The addition of grain to the ration was not economical for the winter period. There was a highly signi­ficant difference (P~.Ol) among the eight groups in summer gains. The greatest diffi­erence between the controls and grain plus summer implants returned $10 per head above treatment costs. Winter supplement and/or DES implants had no significant effect upon feedlot gains (125 day), total gains (367 days) U.S.D.A. carcass quality grade or carcass cutability grade.

Marble Veterinarian University of Nevada Countless numbers of tiny plants that we call bacteria make possible the continuance of life on this planet. They are many in number and found nearly everywhere. Their varied activities bring about essential changes in our environment. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria that live in nodules on the roots of alfalfa help that plant to grow. Bacteria aid in cheese making. Antibiotics come from many different kinds of microorganisms. Only occasionally does an unusual or unexpected manifestation of their power cause serious interference with the welfare or plans of man; for as the great majority of people are law-abiding and helpful to the community -so are the majority of bacteria beneficial to man. Just as it is necessary to control the activities of criminals, it is also necessary to control the activities of harmful bacteria. Bacteria, viruses, protozoa, internal and external parasites and fungus all belong in these categories of helpful or harmful organisms. To understand the way these organisms grow, where they live, how they get from place to place, and what effect they have on their surrounding, helps us better to control them for the benefit of man. Some organisms have specialized and grow only in a very well controlled environment, such as most viruses grow in particular cells of the body -and are destroyed if away from this special environment for a very long period. Some are capable of remaining infective for long periods in some kind of resting stage like the spores of anthrax, or the well protected thick shelled egg of the ascarid parasite. Some live and repro­duce outside the animal body and are only accidental infectious agents of man and animals. Disease organisms may be spread in many ways. 1. Direct contact with infected individual. Ringworm -a fungus infection of the skin is spread by direct contact. Veneral infections such as vibriosis in cattle are spread at breeding time. 2. Contact through Fomites. Fomites are inanimate objects on which organisms may be carried. Bran sacks, bristles in a shaving brush, shoes, clQthing, truck or railroad car and sales barns are good examples of fomites. 3. Contact with a disease carrier. A carrier is an animal or person who carries the disease but may not show symptoms of the disease. seventy to ninety per­cent of the cattle in northern Nevada are carriers of anaplasmosis. With anaplasmosis, however, contact ~lone will not spread it -there must be a transfer of r0d bkood cells in s.:Jl.:e manner. Animals may also be carriers of leptospirosis, Brucellosis and Tularemia. 4. Infection from food and water. Food and water contaminated with typhoid, salmonella, leptospira, anthrax, liver flukes, internal parasites, foot and mouth virus or the rickettsia of salmon poisoning may spread those diseases. 5. Infections from the soil. Blackleg, malignant edema, tetanus and gas gangrene are examples of organisms spread through the soild~ -9­6. Airborne infections usually do not spread far unless attached to Some other carrier. Influenze and the common cold of man may be spread on small droplets of water from a sneeze. Tuberculosis of the lungs may be airborne. Other diseases such as foot and mouth disease and vibriosis of sheep may be carried on the legs of flies, mosquitoes, on the feet of birds, or through the droppings of meat-eating scavenger birds such as magpies, crows, hawks and eagles. 7. Infections are possible from blood sucking arthropods such as mosquitoes which carry malaria and yellow fever of man, Tabanid horse flies, ticks and gnats which carry anaplasmosis and ticks that carry Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. 8. Infections may take place from organisms normally present in the surroundings. Streptococcus, pasteurella and actinomyces necropherous are present in most surroundings. 9. Infections may be spread by man through the improper use of castrating, vacci­nation and dehorning equipment and by the use of infected nose tongues. He may carry infected material on his hands, boots, shoes and clothing. 10. Dog tapeworm cysts are found in rabbits and fleas which are eaten for food or accidentally biten and develop into mature tapeworms. The snail is the inter­mediate host of liver flukes and may carry immature forms of this parasite in irrigation water or streams to new locations. Liver fluke damage is necessary for infection with Black's Disease of sheep. 11. Trace mineral deficiencies may cause depraved appetites with the host ingesting dirt containing harmful bacteria, or it may cause the host to eat bones con­taining infective germs like anthrax, or the toxin of botulism. 12. Urine and discharges from other body openings may splash into the eyes of susceptible animals. If the discharges carry brucellosis or leptospirosis organisms those diseases may result. Some organisms are very hardy and endure very difficult conditions while others need special conditions to live. Anthrax organisms in the spore form have been known to endure 90 years in the soil. Most viruses can live only a short time outside a living cell. To help prevent the spread of a disease we need to know more about the character of the disease organism and what it needs to maintain itself. We need to know.where it lives in the natural state. We need to know some of its habits, then we can begin t9 under­stand how it gets from one host to another. By preventing favorable circumstances for the organism we can prevent spread of disease. sanitation and cleanliness are very important. Nutrition is also very important as it is more difficult for a harmful organism to establish itself in a well fed animal. Microorganisms are nearly everywhere. They may be transported to a new host in any way that does not interfere with the life of the microorganism. Some of those ways may not have been conceived in the minds of men. -10­GRASS TETANY V. R. Bohman Animal Nutritionist University of Nevada Grass tetany has been mentioned several times during the past year. We showed a film last year describing the experimental production of th~s malady or a tetany very similar to this malady and presented the data available at that time. This year we would like to extend the available data just a little bit and indicate the direction in which we are going at this time. I will review briefly some of the things that will tie these presentations together. Grass tetany is a problem which has occurred throughout the world. A recent publi­cation listed some of the areas in which losses occurred from grass tetany. They in­cluded Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Maryland, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Oklahoma and Texas as well as california and Nevada in the United States. It is not limited just to the United States, however, it also occurs in the Netherlands, British Isles, Scandinavia, Germany and New Zealand. Grass tetany then, occurs throughout the entire world and people throughout the world are interested in thiS problem. It is very sporadic where it does occur, however. It might occur one year in one place and elsewhere the next year. It seldom occurs consistently even though conditions appear to be similar. In areas where grass tetany does occur year in and year out, losses may range from 1 to 10%. In small herds it might be much greater than this. Although one may see several things indicating grass tetany, usually a person simply finds the animal dead as he examines the herd. Animals showing early symptoms of grass tetany usually have been noticed to have loss of appetite, are hyper-irritable and have an incoordinated gait. Since this incoordination is seldom seen unless the animals are moving, these early symptoms are seldom seen under range conditions. Many animals show tetany in some of the last stages of the disease. This meanS that the animal actually quivers. The quivering can be seen visually but it doesn't last too long. This is followed by animals going into convulsions and going down. Death usually occurs after this time. Occasionally an animal will recover from these symptoms spontaneously; more frequently, however, none of these symptoms is seen and the animal is dead before any symptoms are noticed. The usual and most specific symptom of grass tetany is an acute hypomagnesemia which occurs before the animal goes into a convulsion. Normal levels of blood magneSium are around 2 mg. per 100 millileters of plasma. If the level drops down to almost 1 it is referred to as hypomagnesemia; and if it drops below 1, tetany can be expected to occur. Plasma calcium is not consistent; sometimes it decreases, sometimes it fails to change at all during grass tetany. There are many problems involved in the production of grass tetany. Often an animal does not consume enough feed to obtain the necessary magnesium reqUired to prevent this malady. For example, a 1000 pound lactating cow should consume 30 pounds of dry matter per day. If the forage contains only 20% dry matter and succulent crested wheatgrass may not even contain this amount, then the animal must eat 150 pounds of feed per day in order to meet these requirements. Under any calculations, that is a lot of hay. Usually it appears that the magnesium content of the forage should be adequate to main­tain the desired level of blood magnesium; however, in green succulent plants this is not often available. High levels of nitrogen or ammonia and potassium tend to decrease the availability of magnesium for the animal. About two years ago the California workers found that range forages where grass tetany was a problem had high levels of organic acids -specifically trans-aconitic acid. Trans-aconitic acid is very similar to citric acid which is one of the organic acids used in soft drinks. As far as the animal is concerned, research has indicated that -11­these animals convert citriC acid to trans-aconitic acid and vice versa. Studies have been conducted at Cornell University which have indicated that certain plants accumulate trans-aconitic acid while others accumulate citric acids. Both of these have been imple­mented with the problem of grass tetany. Approximately two years ago we started to evaluate some of these materials. We have found that citric acid and potassium chloride will lower plasma magnesium in short periods of time; generally one week or less. Tetany can be produced through the use of either citric or trans-aconitic acid plus potassium chloride that resembles grass tetany. Animals showing this tetany will usually respond to intravenous injections of calcium magnesium glucinate. The effective dose of potassium chloride and organic acids required to induce this tetany is related to body weight. Potassium chloride, citric acid, sodium chloride, trans-aconitic acid or salts of these acids do not produce tetany when administered by themselves. Sodium or potassium chloride with either acid produces tetany 50 or 100% of the time when ad­ministered at appropriate levels. Some tetany has been produced in suckling calves grazing crested wheatgrass pastures. In regard to recommended procedures for minimizing losses, one might use steers or dry animals rather than lactating cows. Some of the British and Netherlands workers have indicated that fertilizing pastures with magnesium is beneficial for spraying~astures with magnesium salt as a topical dressing also helps. This method does not seem applicable for Nevada. Work in South Dakota has indicated that dietary supplements containing extra magnesium oxide (one-half ounce per day) and calcium gave some control. This control is only effective if all animals apparently receive some of the supplements each day and because of this it is not 100% effective. Progress is being made in understanding this malady and with such understanding it is hoped that suitable control measures will be possible. -12­WATER BELLY Earl L. Drake, BS, DVM Ext. Veterinarian University of Nevada Urinary calculi or urolithiasis, more commonly called Water Belly, is an insidious ail­ment of male cattle, sheep, horses, swine and other species, including man. In humans the condition is called kidney stones. It occurs under both range conditions and feed­lot conditions but heaviest loses are reported under range or semi-range conditions. It can occur at any time but usually appears in late fall or early winter following weaning and cold weather. Stockmen are becoming more conscious of the losses caused by Water Belly and in at least one survey last year ranked it third as a cattle killer in the western states. Just What is Water Belly? Water Belly is a disorder of the kidneys and urinary tract in which stones or calculi form and block the excretion of urine. Many of the small stones are discharged with the urine without causing harm; however, some grow large enough to lodge in the urethra (the tube which empties the bladder) stopping the normal flow of urine. In this event the bladder may overfill and sometimes break, emptying urine into the body cavity and causing a subsequent toxemia from the absorption of waste urine products back into the body. The stones are actually formed in the uriniferous tubules or in the pelvis of the kidney or in the bladder. Symptoms of Water Belly. Early symptoms include restlessness, frequest attempts to urinate with only a small a­mount passed, leaving stones on the preputial hairs, humping of the back, straining, passing of small amounts of blood frOm the rectum, stretching, wringing of the tail, kicking at the belly, getting up and down and all the symptoms of colic. There is a characteristic pulsating of the urethra which is distended with urine which can be pal­pated through the rectal wall. When these pain symptoms subside the bladder or urethra has broken. The symptoms which follow are swelling in the sheath and lower body wallar enlarged abdomen, depending on where the perforation was. A characteristic is a pear shaped appearance to the animal when viewed from the rear and a water slosh when the belly is balloted. The animal runs a normal to subnormal temperature and shows signs of auto-intoxication. Later the temperature may rise due to peritonitis. The eyes, nose and mouth will develop a characteristic muddy appearance. The muzzle will later scale. The obstruction is characterized by pain. The urethral perforation by swelling about the ~heath and bladder rupture by peritonitis and enlarged lower abdomen due to accumulation of urine; uremia by toxic muddy membranes. . Diagnosis is made by: 1. Clinical signs. 2. A rectal to see if the bladder is distended. 3. Milking the prepuce down to see if the animal will urinate. 4. Normal to subnormal temperature with signs of uremia. 5. Paracenticis to see if there is urine in the abdominal cavity. -13­Considerable study has been made of the composition of the stones in order to arrive at a prevention. It has been found that composition of calculi differs between and within species, depending on the pH of the urine. Thus in range cattle the urine is acid and the stones are composed of silicates and are 'related to the silica content of forage; whereas in feedlot animals the urine is alkaline and the stones are composed of phos­phate calcium and magnesium ~ith varying amounts of nitrogenous material and other mineral salts and are most common on high concentrate rations. The feedlot cattle re­ceive an excess of calcium and phosphorus from the legume hay and grain. In calculi formation a nuclei develops when the urine is concentrated. This provides the nucleus of the stone. The formation of the stone is dependent upon the availability of mag­nesium is less important than the level relative to calcium and phosphorus. The lowest incidence is accompanied by a Ca:P ratio of 5:1 and the highest incidence occurred in a ratio of less 1:3. When large concentrations of sodium and chloride ions are present, initial nucleation and subsequent crystal growth are prevented due to the tieup of mag­nesium and phosphorus. It is the theory of some investigators that a high phosphorus level in the kidney in­jures the renal tubules. This damage permits the release of large molecules of protein into the urine and this increases the urine muco-protein level thus changing the colloidal system of the urine. An increased incidence of water belly is associated with early castration as this leaves the urethra smaller than normal. The following conditions seem to predispose to calculi formation. 1. Early castration. 2. Vitamin A deficiency. 3. Rations containing sorghum products. 4. Reduced water intake. 5. Imbalance of minerals. 6. High silica content of the forage. 7. The upset of the urine colloid system. 8. Many types of urinary infections which cause protein precipitat~ and cellular debris to cling to silicate particles. 9. High estrogen content of feeds. The amount of calculi formation increased abruptly when all concentrate rations became popular. The stone formation does not affect performance until there is complete stoppage. Certain feeds have been blamed -sorghum grain and fodder, sub-clover pastures, oat fodder and grains, bran. About the only feeds to date given a clean bill of health are alfalfa hay, corn, barley and beet tops. Implanting with diethylstilbestrol does not seem to increase the incidence of calculi formation. -14­A reduction in incidence can be affected by: 1. Deferring castration until about 8 months of age which results in 30% in­crease in size of the urethra. 2. Use of water heaters in cold weather. 3. Increase water consumption by force feeding 3-10% salt in the regular ration. Feeding a protein concentrate meal or protein concentrate pellet containing from 10-20% salt has been successful on calves. Ad­dition of this salt to the creep ration a little ahead of weaning time is good practice. 4. In all types of calculi, ammonium chloride fed at the rate of one-tenth pound per day has prevented stone formation. It is common practice to feed 1.5% ammonium chloride mixed with grain. 5. Vitamin A supplementation has been used for prevention but results have been variable. 6. The enzyme hyaluronidase which can disperse the urine colloidal matter in a finely divided state has shown some success. Treabment 1. Early diagnosis and use of alkalizon or acidifycin. 2. Increase water intake. 3. Urinary antiseptics. 4. Smooth muscle relaxants. 5. Surgery. 6. Use of hylauronadase to desolve stones. Conclusion Early diagnosis, changes in management, changes in diet, medication and surgery can prevent loss from urinary calculi. -15­HIGH QUALITY FALL RANGE FEED BY CHEMICAL CURING Robert Raleigh Squaw Butte Expt. Station Range forage decreases in quality with forage maturity so that by early July both protein and energy are limiting production on range livestock. Yearling cattle on this type of range feed gain 2.0 pounds or more daily during May and June, 1.5 pounds or less during July, less than a pound in August and relatively no gain after the first of september. Research at this Station over the past several years has shown that chemical curing of range forage during June, at a time when nutrients are adequate for a high level of livestock production, can provide a good quality forage for fall grazing. Digestibility studies with forage cured with paraquat l in June and harvested in the fall gave values significantly higher than naturally cured forage harvested at the same time. Preference trials with cattle and sheep indicate that the chemically cured forage is acceptable. Grazing trials were conducted during the summers of 1966 and 1967 to determine the effect of chemically cured forage on nutrient intake and livestock performance. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Two crested wheatgrass pastures of 30 acres each were used for the study in 1966. One of the pastures was sprayed June 16-18 with 0.3 lb./acre paraquat in 20 gallons of water using 0.5% X-77. The other pasture was left untreated. Yearling heifers with an average weight of 684 pounds were allotted to each pasture based on the estimated carrying capacity. Fourteen heifers were put in the control pasture and 13 in the treated pasture. Eight, IS-acre crested wheatgrass pastures were used in the study in 1967, with 4 pastures for controls and 4 pastures sprayed with 0.2 lb./acre of paraquat in 10 gallons of water with 0.5% x-77. The spraying was done with a ground rig from June 23-26. Twenty-four yearling heifers, with an average weight of 664 pounds, were stratified by weight to each of 4 replications and 2 treatments with 3 animals per pasture, making 12 animals on paraquat treated forage and 12 animals on control forage. The 1966 trial ran for a total of 36 days from August 16 to September 21, while the 1967 trial ran for a total of 75 days from August 14 to October 30. The animals were weighed at the beginning, midway through and at the end of the trial period each year. Water, salt and bonemeal intake records were kept for each pasture take was determined using a water intake method, for cattle samples were collected weekly from each pasture. in in each each trial and pasture. forage Forage in­OBSERVATIONS Gain data are presented for both years in Table 1. Average daily gains of the animals were 1.69 and 1.2 pounds for the animals on the chemically cured and naturally cured forage, respectively, in 1966 and 0.91 and 0.34 pounds for the respective treatments in 1967. Probably the difference in years can best be explained by Table 2 which shows the crude protein values during the time of grazing. This follows the usual pattern for 1 Paraquat (1,1'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium di(methylsulphate)) was supplied by the chevron Chemical Co. which also partially financed this research.

However, the differences between the auntreated forage are of the same magnitude each year. seasons such nimal gains from as the the Table 1. Average daily gain of animals for 1966 and 1967.

Forage moisture, water intake and estimated forage intake are presented in Table 3. Forage intake follows the same pattern as daily gain with the animals on the treated pastures consuming more forage than animals on the control pastures, indicating no problems with palatability or acceptability. No particular pattern was evident with re­gard to salt and bonemeal intake with the treated or untreated forage. These trials were designed to evaluate the comparative quality of the forage from chemically and naturally cured forage. Therefore, stocking rate was not controlled as it would need to be under practical operations. The pastures were stocked at a relatively light rate so the animals would have an opportunity to express their full potential in -17­terms of daily gain. Studies have shown that stocking for light (about 50%) utilization will give greatest daily gain whereas stocking to a moderately heavy (about 75%) utili~ zation will reduce daily gain per head but increase gain per acre. Type of cattle, other available resources, cost of pasture and other factors enter into making the decision on stocking rate. Generally the higher stocking rate would be employed. The gain per acre in the second year of this study was 4.5 pounds from the untreated forage and 13.7 pounds from the paraquat treated forage. Assuming a value of 25 cents per pound for this gain gives a gross return of $1.12 and $3.42, respectively, from the control and treated forage. It was estimated that about two-thirds of the forage available under a practical stocking rate was used in this study indicating that the pastures could have been stocked 50% higher which would have resulted in a return per acre approaching $1.65 and $5.10, respectively, for the control and treated pasture. The application of paraquat curing of forage would seem to be best adapted to higher producing ranges, since cost of application per acre would be near equal for high or low producing ranges. Fertilization can increase production up to 50% and this could make the economics of chemical curing of forage more favorable. These factors will be further evaluated. Table 3.

Sharp Forestry Department University of Idaho Crested wheatgrass seedings have become an important part of the forage resources in the Intermountain country. In Idaho alone, over one million acres of rangeland have been seeded to this introduced grass species. Without these seedings many ranchers would not be in the livestock business today. A sizeable body of knowledge has accumulated over the last decade on grazing of crested wheatgrass. Studies in Utah, New Mexico, Oregon, Nevada and Idaho provide us with in­formation about the growth characteristics; carbohydrate reserve levels, nutritive value and the response of crested wheatgrass to various patterns of graZing. This information has been derived from both clipping and grazing studies. A wide variety of graZing programs can be developed for crested wheatgrass ranges using the knowledge that is available from research and experience. In developing grazing pro­grams for ranges seeded to crested wheatgrass, limitations imposed by the characteristics of the grass must ranch operation. be considered along with the needs of graZing animals and the particular Characteristics of Crested Wheatgrass Important in Management Planning Crested wheatgrass is well adapted to sagebrush soils of the Intermountain region and will also grow on some soils with higher salt contents than the sagebrush soils. In southern Idaho, growth generally starts in mid-March to early April and proceeds slowly through April until early May. Production at Point Springs on April 1 was approximately 70 pounds per acre in 1967 and 85 pounds per acre in 1968. Growth was between four and six pounds per acre per day during April and averaged about 200 pounds the first of May in 1967. With the advent of warmer temperatures in May, the growth rate increased to 20 pounds per day per acre and continued to increase in early June to about 25 pounds per day. Precipitation was well distributed in May and June of 1967 and a higher growth rate was obtained than might normally occur. Growth is generally complete by mid-July but in years of summer precipitation some growth may continue until fall. Green growth develops in the fall of some years when moisture and temperature conditions are suitable. The stem apex of crested wheatgrass is near the surface of the ground until early May, elongates rapidly until late Mayor early June. Heads emerge from the boot in late Mayor early June and flowering occurs from mid-to late June. As long as the stem apex is intact the stem will continue to grow. Once the stem apex has been removed that stem ceases to grow and all regrowth must come from buds at the base of the grazed stem. The new stem mayor may not produce a seed head. This new growth, however, is often more leafy than the original stem that was first grazed. Work at Squaw Butte indicates that root growth is most active in April and early May. Total root growth and production is directly related to the severity and frequency of defoliation. The accumulation of carbohydrates in the roots and stem bases of crested wheatgrass be­gins early in the growth cycle. The rate of accumulation' is rapid until about flowering time when a moderate decrease occurS. FollOWing seed maturity, carbohydrate accumu­lations continue. -19­Suitability of Crested Wheatgrass in Meeting Animal Requirements The nutritive value of crested ~heatgrass is high in early April (16-19% protein) and likely meets all the requirements of the animal for growth and lactation. However, at this time, new production is limited (80-100 pounds dry matter per acre) and it is difficult for an animal to obtain a sufficient dry matter intake unless there is some forage carry-over from the previous year. Production by mid-April or early May is generally sufficiently high to permit the animals to satisfy their requirements for dry matter intake. During May and early June, growth rate is generally sufficient to meet all the animal's requirements. Protein content in mid-summer varies considerably with precipitation but averages be­tween 4 and 8% and this drops to as low as 3% in the late fall. Nutrient deficiencies develop in the fall and winter and the grass should be supplemented with other feeds. The Effects of Defoliation on Plant Production Crested wheatgrass is admirably adapted to periods of moderate or severe levels of de­foliation. Crested wheatgrass stands have been maintained up to 30 years even under close graZing. Continued close foliage removal over a period of years decreases plant vigor, plants fragment, forage production decreases and annual plants increase in a­mount. Clipping studies in Utah and Oregon show that: (1) herbage production decreases more with closer clipping than less close clipping; (2) decreases more ~ith increased fre­quency of clipping and (3) decreases less by early clipping (April to May 1) than late clipping (June 15 to July 1), but production is least from plants clipped in mid-season (May 15 to June 1). Root growth, production and carbohydrate concentrations in the roots and stem bases are related to time of defoliation. Root growth is most affected by clipping in late April-early May. Fall carbohydrate accumulations are least when plants are clipped in mid-June. Grazing studies at Point Springs show that forage production declines most under heavy continuous graZing in the spring. There is little difference between light and moderate spring graZing on forage production. A greater number of course plants (Wolf) occur under light grazing and use is uneven through the stand of grass. Stand density (number of plants per unit area) is a function of grazing intensity and weather conditions. Initially, heavy graZing may cause an apparent increase in stand density as the plants fragment and break up. Plant numbers decrease as 'excessive im­properly timed defoliation continues. Weather conditions during the spring of· the year influence the rate at which plants fragment or remain intact. Although plant numbers may not decline, the distribution of the plants over the area be­comes less uniform with heavy spring grazing. Plant distribution is also influenced by weather conditions and soil characteristics as well as grazing intensity. The most serious consequence of excessive defoliation on crested wheatgrass is the re­duced plant area and consequeotly the number of tillers per plant Or per unit area. Under heavy grazing at Point Springs, plant area was 6.2 square inches compared to 10.5 square inches with no grazing. The number of tillers per 'square foot was 41 under heavy grazing and 68 under protection from grazing. -20­Factors Affecting the Quality of the Grass Ungrazed or lightly used crested wheatgrass becomes stemmy and coarse compared to more heavily used stands. Subsequent quality of feed and animal performance are enhanced by grazing at same moderate level. Animal performance both spring and fall has generally been better at Point Springs in those fields grazed both spring and fall compared to those grazed only in the spring or only in the fall. Forage quality is also affected by growing conditions of a particular year. years with deficient moisture limit plant growth but the herbage is often of a better quality be­cause of leaf to stem ratio than in years when ample moisture and warm temperatures in­duce rapid growth. Some Suggested Management Programs Suitable grazing programs can be developed for the use of crested wheatgrass if growth characteris tics of the plant are cons idered. Use may be heavy in any year but muS t be alternately timed during the season in a yearly sequence to permit the plants to main­tain vigor and consequently high forage production. Spring ~ of the Same Area If the area is to be grazed in the spring from mid-April or early May to late June or July) a moderate rate of grazing use is recommended. Soil moisture becomes deficient in mid-to late June in most years and regrowth is not possible. Residue on the ground after graZing should be about 150 pounds per acre under this intensity of use. A more suitable spring grazing program would be to divide the area in 2 parts so that one field is used during the early part of the season and the second during the latter part of the season. The tUne of use for each field would alternate each year. There need not be much concern about the level of graZing in the field used first as there is ample moisture in most years for regrowth. This leafy regr'owth can be used again in the fall after the plant has accumulated carbohydrate reserves. The main concern should be to see that the animals have ample forage for optimum production. The only reason to leave some forage residue in the field grazed during the second part of the season is to provide some dry material that may permit a slightly earlier turn-on date the following spring. Limited data at Point Springs (2 years) indicate that higher animal gains can be maintained through the second part of the spring in this way than under continuous grazing of one area. Spring-Fall Use of the Same Area It is recommended that areas to be grazed spring and fall should be use~ at a light or moderate intensity in the spring followed by any reasonable intensity in the fall. Light or moderate spring use (50-65%) will maintain stand density, forage productivity and insure high gain per animals. The fall graZing will clean up the residue) prevent or minimize the deve lopment of "wol f plants" and pennit more even grazing the following spring. Rotation GraZing Flexability in making management decisions is enhanced if the range can be divided into 3 or 4 fields. One field in the group can be rested from graZing each year during the growing season and used during the fall and/or winter. The fields to be rested are alternated each year. This will permit restoration of plant vigor and insure optimum forage production. Two or 3 of the fields can be used in the spring at any intensity suitable for desired animal production. Regrowth will often develop on the field or fields used up to May 25 and thiS regrowth can be used in the fall. If summer graZing is desired it can be worked into the rotation system so that no field is used at exactly the same time of the year in the sequence of the rotation. -21­A NEW LOOK AT MARKETING E, R. Barme.ttler Ext. Production Economist University of Nevada The title assigned me by Bill Behrens was "A New Look at Marketing.'· Now this could mean several things. First, it could mean that perhaps we have been missing something in marketing that ought seriously to be considered. second, it could mean that we ought to look at marketing with a different point of view or perhaps in a different way. Most of you have heard me talk about marketing before. I like to think of marketing as an on-going process, because it is very difficult for me to separate marketing from pro­duction. . I would like to have you carryon a conversation with me this morning, that is, I hope you will ask questions as we go along. I think we can communicate better that way. What is happening in the agricultural market scene? "~at is happening to the livestock­man? These are questions that have been raised recently. They are the questions raised by NFO (Natl. Farmers Organization) and the American Natl. Cattlemens Association. I think there are changes which make it imperative that we seek to answer these questions and that we look to a new approach in marketing agricultural products. Lets look at marketing from the rather practical income point of view. To do this I will direct your attention to my first chart. FARM INCOME COMPONENTS 1950 '55 '60 '65 1950 '55 '60 '65 ~t1 'r.... TeL o 10 S Bll.-----.-------,-~~-.,.-, 20 30 .40 On the left hand side of chart No, 1, it shows the realized gross income from agriculture. In 1966 the total income was just short of 50 billion dollars. Slightly over 43 billion dollars of this income came from marketing, that is, the goods and services farmers and ranchers had for sale, ,On the right side the chart is the same except that it shows what farmers and ranchers had to payout to others for goods and services to produce a realized net income of something in excess of 16 billion dollars in 1966. Another -22­interesting thing about chart No.1 is that it shows costs to producers have been in­creasing rapidly, whereas net income has remained rather even except in the year 1966. In chart No. 2 we can see what has been happening on the farm or ranch. There has been a steady increase in the output per man hour of farm labor and a significant increase in the output for all units of input. In other wo,rds, farmers and ranchers have been economizing by doing things in such a way that they got greater returns for each unit of input they used. The chart shows that farmers used significantly less labor each year from 1950 to the present. fl•• III'UT5 AND OUTPUI 'EI UIIIT OF IIIPUT 280 t-------,,--+-----+---~=l_-=__-_1 • 220 ~~---f=---+--:.>"''=--_+_---~ 160 r-----+---/---+---..--+---~-___i 1970 Since I said originally that I would look at marketing as a continuing foundation of pro­duction, the next chart, chart No.3 is important. It is the chart that looks at agri­cultural output from the consumer's sector. On the very bottom of chart No.3 is the amount consumers have spent for food from their total disposable income. The total food bill in 1966 amounted to something over 89 billion dollars. The total disposable income in 1966 was nearly 510 billion dollars in 1966. Although the absolute amount spent for food has been increasing, the proportion of dollars spent by consumers for food has steadily decreased. In fact, almost every year since 1950 consumers have had to spend slightly less of their disposable income for food. This is reflected in our next chart. Chart No.4 shows that in 1967 consumers had to spend about 17.7% of their income for food. There is another aspect of consumer spending that we as farmers and ranchers have not been sufficiently concerned about. It fits in with chart No.4 and in a way reflects a retailing dimension that has a direct impact upon our ability to sell livestock products. How many of you have really looked at the products sold in your retail grocery stores. I sometimes walk through a grocery store and marvel at the many different products available to the modern consumer. I also observe the changes that occur from time to time. In coming through Elko, for example, I walked through one of the leading Nevada grocery retail outlets and noticed two large sections of this store had nothing but quick cooking macaroni products. From my own observation I judge that these sections composed 5-10% of the food display area of this one store. One product, a beef-macaroni item, sold for 39~ a can. From my own experimentation in my own kitchen I know that the beef fraction is less than 3~ ounces. A little bit of ordinary arithmetic will show you this beef is in the 2 to 3 dollar category. .-23­IICOME liD OPENDITUIES $ IIL..----r----..------;r-r--_r_---~_r_-___, 500 f---~--_+--_r--""""t"'"--_r__:::::; 400 300 I----~I.-.........,t_:: 200 100 o o DC'L...,.,...."." ,. e..,...., ..~......,.1.

There are 3 Unportant things about these products that have an important impact on our economy. First, people are paying a high price for some products which are essentially low in nutritional value and in product quality. second, the quality factors so painstakingly built into the livestock products industry are being bypassed, i.e., if you will observe the labels on the example products I have just shown you, it simply states that the product was U.S. inspected. This probably means that its cow beef and probably it was imported from New Zealand or Australia. There is nothing on the package that would suggest that it was USDA Good, Choice or Prime, Maybe it doesn't matter, but if you will think about what this means, it says the same thing on a can of dog food, The third or most important thing is the fact that these products are being accepted more and more by our consumer -she in fact is paying a champagne price for a poverty diet. Another aspect about chart No. 5 and entirely aside from what I have already said earlier about consumer expenditures for food is the fact that we cannot point to any other industry that has year after year shown a characteristic decrease in the proportion of consumer dollars spent for its goods and services. There are probably very few people present here today that would claim that their costs 'for housing, for transportation or recreation or any other important activity have decreased. The proportion of consumer expenditures has for the most part held steady or has increased. Agricultural producers have in fact been forced to produce these efficiencies in order to survive. It seems to me that the questions asked by the several different organizations representing. agri­culture. are in fact, how long can agriculture continue to produce these sorts of ef­ficiencies without a serious threat to the current organizational structure of American agriculture? It is granted that there are many more efficiencies to be gained in agricultural pro­duction, Chart No. 5 shows the total amount American consumers pay for food. It shows about 86~ million dollars for the total food bill. About 28~ billion dollars of that total represents the farm value for food products made available to American consumers. This leaves about 58 billion dollars for the costs of services that go into food products between the farm and the retail checkout stand. To me this chart means that farmers and ranchers need to become more concerned with the off farm or off ranch activities of their businesses, Even though there are continued -25­efficiencies to be realized within the 28~ billion dollar on farm industry, there are even better opportunities to accrue advantages in 58 billion dollar off farm activities of agriculture It is in the off farm 0'[' off ranch sector that the National Cattlemens Association is seeking to acquire a bargaining edge. Similarly, National Farmers organization is demanding a stronger bargaining edge through their programs of supply management .

To me it meanS that the consumer price for meat products will in­crease or that the on farm price for cattle will decrease or perhaps both conditions will come to pass. However, there is simply no way of getting around the fact that many services must be added to the product before it can be effectively marketed to the modern housewife. I remember as a boy trying to market live chickens from house to house. I reme~ber saying lady, do you want to buy a chicken. These were live birds and you know I was always pretty well able to sell all I had. Today I don't think you would have much success -I think that the housekeeper on the tenth floor of the Arlington Towers would be scared to death if you offered her a live bird for tonight's dinner. Also, notice that transportation is a significant cost in the marketing of agricultural products. The next chart shows more clearly the part that labor has played in food marketing costs. You will notice that there has been a sharp rise in per unit labor costs since 1964. It seemS to me that there are important opportunities for marketing to bring additional technology into the food handling sectors of the marketing system. -26 ­FOOD MARKETING LABOR COSTS % OF 195 7 ·59""--~~'--------""----'---~~---' 140r---+----+----t----+~-__t--___l 8 0 '--.L...-....L..-.....I...-....1----'---...l..-----L----L.---'-----JL.-.-.L..--.L...-....L..-.....I...-....1----'-----'-----' 120 f----+----+__ 100-r----t-~~~.....;;;;~_+_T_-_+_--_+_--__1 1953 '56 '59 '62 '65 '68 '71 DOJI,fn/C" , .........,..ODclC"lro ;'400 ,;irOOuC'rJ. $L.AlOilt CO,,· "., U'iiU' 0' ,-OOD JlliIII.tIl("I"7fD. ·'HCLoUtli,f,J JU"""'.E,JIl n TO If... £n ""~ Sa ....... .,,, ·PItWL.""'iIlI".". U. l. OIE".lff.JjlE.... T 0' A~lC"ULT'UIt(Chart numbers 8 and 9 tend to summarize the things I have tried to say to you this morning, In chart No.8 it shows that the farmer has held rather constant to about 38­40% of the consumer's food dollar. However, it is not so obvious that he will be able to maintain that ratio in the face of the changing costs structure occurring in the off farm sector of the agricultural marketing system. Chart No. 9 shows that consumers have shown a rather strong preference for beef and veal products, however, this too is subject to change, particularly as price is drawn up to the retail level due to the inflexability of the off farm costs for services going into this and other products. In summary, it seems obvious that agricultural producers must take a stronger interest in what happens to their products once it leaves the r_och or farm. Perhaps it mea~s that producers must become willing to integrate their operations or it means that producers will be required to produce products specifically tailored to a given market and this under some rather rigid contractual arrangement. perhaps as suggested by the American National Cattlemens Association, some means must be found to control supply because surely if the supply of a commodity becomes over large, price will decline. The argument that producers of agricultural products are too diverse in their interests to coordinate their activity will not be adequate for solving the survival dilemma. The problems of marketing defies easy solution even if the industry had more control and were in a better bargaining position, controls of the sort suggested above would encroach upon the independents (free) decision-making prerogatives of farmers and ranchers. And even if there were a good deal more agreement with agricultural subsectors concerning markets and marketing, it would still be difficult to insulate against surpluses. As far as I am concerned, however, some sort of coordinative activity is surely part of the new look in marketing. Even more, the coordinative aspect of future marketing systems will take in much larger regions than individual counties or for that matter states. In talking about livestock marketing it probably will involve the whole of the western region or perhaps it will need to be national in scope if we hope to compete effectively with imports. 60 FARMER'S SHARE Of CONSUMER'S RETAIL FOOD DOLLAI* .0 60 I It Farmer'5 5hore"Marketing share CENITS .1. n u ., II .0 1957 I '59' '61 '65 '69 '71 -27­.

The current results areatleast suggestions which the farmer can try out on a small scale without risking much expenditure. For that reason the Experiment Statio11's policy is to publish each season's results iiz its Annual Report covering the period during which they were obtained, and to present them in sufficient detail to be as informative as possible to the farmer. Prom time to time, as rcsults accumulate and indicate the desirability of publishing summaries of the fertility investigations covering periods of several years, such s~unn~nriwesil l be isslircl as separate publications. This project was originally entitled, "EtTect of Fertilizer Treatment on the Yielcl and Chemical Composition of Small Grains and Legumes Grown on the Light-Textured Soils of the Carson Valley," but the title has been changed to conform with the enlarged scope of operations in the program of soil fertility investigations. Dnring the period covcred by this report, ,July 1, 1949, to June 30, 1950, experimental work was done on two fields in Donglas County, one field in Churchill County, and four fields in Pershing County. In addi-tion, two fields were establishecl in Washoe County, on the Experiment Station Farm on north Valley Road, Reno. This department also cooperated in the work on Project 70, Iocated in the Moapa Valley at Logandale, Nevada, to the extent of outlining soil treatments, laying out the plot series, and applying the treatments, in the field experiment dealing with proclnction 01 tomato transplants. The results of that experiment are reported uncler Project 70, which appears elsewhere in this Station report. The genera1 plan on which the fertility experiments are laid out and conducted was explained in the preceding Annual Report and need not be repeated here. This present report gives the results obtained on the fieids in the 1949 season. Tlie results are presented in tabular form, under the heacling for the particular field, aiid the treatments applied for the 1949 crop, as well as the treatments which the plota had received in previous years, are included in the table. The various treatments involved in the experiment on a particular field are listed as to lriad, ancl also numbered, in the table giving the results. It should be noted that in those cases wherc the same field has been in operation for more thaiz one year, a trealment number not only designates the lrind of treatment given in each year, but also stands for the scqnence of treatlnents given those particular plots during the years the experiment has beell under way. This point should be borne ill mind because, as a rule, a treatment given in a particular year affects the soil not only cluriiig illat scason, but may have a residual influence in subsequent years.

Disczusion. As was mentioned in last year's report, the alfalfa planted on this field in the spring of 1949 was drowlled out by excess water which got on the plot area during irrigations of the large field adjacent. It was also stated that a green manure treatment (sweet clover plowed under) woulcl be given certain of the plots, to assist in loosening the soil. Yellow biennial sweet clover was seeded on all plots which had been treated with limestolze or with gypsum. The plots which had received no treatment, or treatment with conlplete fertilizer, were not planted to sweet clover, but remained fallow through the season. In the spring of 1950 a good stand of sweet clover appeared on the plots to which i t had been seeded. Before the sweet clover was plowed under, certain of those plots, and the plots without clover (except the no treatment plots) were given phosphate or complete fertilizer treat-ments- these will be explained in a later report presenting yield data from the field. Following the plowing of the field and preparation of the seedbed, all plots were seecled to Ranger alfalfa on June 30, 1950. ERNST FIELD, u m u m aouNm Locution.

The grain was harvested on August 3, 194!). The yields, l>rese~lte(j1l1 Table 1, bring out several points of interest.

The surface soil varies, over the field, from a darlr-gray silt loam to a lighter gray, coarse sandy loam. The subsoil is a light gray, 38 NEVADA AGIRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION I ANNUAL REPORT BOARD OF CONTROL 39 coarse sand. The soil is about neutral; from the surface to a depth of three feet, pI-I values fall within the range of 6.5 to 7.5. Discz~ssion. It was mentioned in last year's report that the crop htended for this field in the 1049 season mas a mixture of ladino clover, alsike clover, ancl timothy; and that this misture mas seeded 00 the plots in April 1949. A nurse crop of oats was included, As in the previous year, no stand of clovers and timothy was obtained. I-Iow-ever, the oat crop matured, and was harvested for grain in mid- August. The yields f ronl the cliff erent treatments are given in Table 2. In appraising tlle results for tlie 1949 season, it should be noted that none of the plots on the field received ally treatment for that 1 season. Thus, the several significant illcreases in the grain yields Icere due to the cumulative effects of the treatments which liad been given in previous years. Sc~rc>raol f tllcse increases were appreciable, and 1 it is to be noted that they rcsultcd from treatment sequences which had included an application of phosphate, either alo~le or in combina-tion with othcr materials, for the 1947 crop (winter wlicat, seeded and fertilized in the fall of 1946). Plots which had ineceived phosphate at that time proclucccl good stands of swept clover ; and the clover, turned under as green manure in the spring of 1948, mas of decided benefit to the oat hay crop in that season. The results given in Table 2 sllo~vn markcd rcsidunl effect of that green inallure treatment, on ihc oat grain crop in 1949. The beneficial effect was probably due largely to nitrogen supplied in the green manure. Durillg its growth, the clover tool: a goocl deal of nitrogen from the air, and, on being plowed under, deposited it in the soil. The addition of tllis nitrogei~, plus the preseilce in the soil of residual pl~osphorus from the previous phosphate applicntioa, provided the coml~ination of nutrient elements-nitrogen and phosphorus-which this lancl necds. The incorporntioll of organic matter improves soil co~lditio~iins nrays other than throagh supplying nutrients, and these other effects-improved aeration, water-holdiag capacity, bacterial action, etc.--of course hclped to iiicluce the increased yields. But wjthout the ilitropen mhicll the clover added, it is probable that the yield increases would have becn appreciably smaller. As stated in previous reports, it had becn the plan to get a mixture of ladino clover, alsike clover, and timothy established on this field; and this mixtnre was seeded in the 1948 and 1949 sensons, but no stancl was obtaiilecl either time.

In Imt year's report the fact was mentioned that sweet clover was seeded with the wheat iu the sprhg of 1948, as a green 40 NEVADA AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION manure crop to be plowed uilder in tlie spring of 1949. Excellent stands of the clover developecl on all the plots. Before the field was plowed i11 preparation for tlic 1949 seeding, the clover on tlie lour No-Treatment plots was cut and removed. In order to get an idea of ho~v rnucli organic matter and ilitrogen were turned ~ u ~ d0e11~ th, e plots wliicli received tlie green nltLiinre treatment, the clover t;ilceil from the No-Treatment plots was cnrecl, ~veighed, and a composite sample talcen lor iiitrogeli analysis.

Thus tlie amoimt of clover plo~vccl 1111tlcr (at least 2.5 tons), per acre, adtlecl 135 pouncls ol' nitroge~l. Tt would take about 660 pounds of ammonium snlfate, to supply this much iiitrogeu. The cost of the nitrogen obtained Illrough ldo~vingu ~ ~ t l ethre sweet clover, as compared with its rost if purcliaseil as sulfate oP anumo~~iias ,o f ciecided interest. I11 19-18, nitrogen in sulfate 01 ammonia cost approximately 18 cents per pouncl; ancl in 1049, about 10 cents. The sweet clover (green manure) treatment cost $10.30, a ~ \ dit put 135 pounds of nitro-gen into the soil. Thus the nitrogen obtaincd ill this way cost only 8 cents per po~uid. The growth of sweet clover on the plots was heavy, and was clisced twice before plowing. The field was l~lowccl aud discccl on Jnne 3, 1949, and prcirrigated on June 10, A meek later the plots were seeded to Ranger alfalfa, wit11 a nurse prop ol 1)arley (Trebi). The barley was harvested (by combii~e)o n October 17, 1949. Ail plots haci an excellent stalid of alfalfa in the s l~r ingo f 1950. Resnlts with the barlcy crop are presented in Table 3. Probably tlie p o ~ not ne would notice first is the behavior of Treatment (sequence) No. 5, i. e., sulfur in 1948 followed by green manure the following spring. In 1948 the sulfur producccl neither a goocl nor a bad effect, on this field, as lar as producing a yield sigiiiiicniitly tlifferent from that on the KO-Treatment plots was concerned, But this year, it held rlowi~ tlie barley yield; it did not clepress the yield below that from No Treatment, hut seemiiigly it prevented the green nlaliure from giv-ing an increase, ~vhiclit he latter otherwise would l~robablyh ave clone. This view appears to be justified by the rcs~lltI ' I - o ~ IT reatment No. 0- just the green manure alone, without previo~ls ireutlnent of any kind. Cases of a similar lrincl occiirred on several oP the fields in the 1048 season; i. e., tlle presence or snlfi~r in n tret~tineut involving other constituents prevented those coastit~~elitSsr om p~~oduciiiign creases, althongli they materially increased the yield when applied without sulfur. I t wo~l (sle em that all the sipiiificaiit illcreases i11 the barley yields in this 1949 season can be ascribed niaiiily to the effect of the green maanre. Tl~ein crease given by Treatment No. 9 is of the same order as the other iilcreases; i11 fact, with the possible exception of Treatment No. 4, none of the treatments procluced increases sigiiific;mtly different from that produced by Treatment No. 9. In this and previous aiinual reports we have stl.csseil the need for restoration or addition of organic matter to the soil, the possibility of ANNUAL REPORT BOARD OF CONTROL ij . . 2 , ,. , 2 oi / i i i \, j1 j1 j: g 2a I Ii Ii Ii 42 NEVADA AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STA~PION achieving this through the practice of applying green manure, and the desirability of fitting this practice illto the cropping scheme in such a way as to avoid the loss of a season for regular crop production. This year's operations on the I-Iolmstrom field have demonstrated the feasibility of accomplishing that purpose ; a good green manure treat-ment was made, a crop of barley was obtained, and alfalfa was estab-lished on the plots. Success in employiilg sweet clover in this manner depends mainly on spring weather conditions, which, of course, vary from one season to another. As these experimeilts progress, the adapta-bility of this practice to Nevada conditions will be more clearly defined. 011 the average, the growing season in Nevada is appreciably shorter than in many other farming regions of the country. In a season with a very late spring, sweet clover might 1101 make wifficient growth, for plotviilg under, until a time too late to permit sowiilg grain with a fair expectation that it would mature. In such a sitiiation, recourse could be had to a crop which inay be harvested earlier than grain. In the 1949 season we tried, on the Ilolmstroin field, a mixture of oats and field peas (for hay) as a crop which coulcl substitute for grain in pro-ducing some income from the land, in a late season, after sweet clover was turned under. This trial was made on an off-plot area of the field, just east of the main plot series. The area was variable as to allcalinity ; portions were bare of vegetation, while others had some weecls, mostly bassia. No fertilizer or other treatment was given this area on wliich t,he oat-field-pea crop vvas planted, so that the only i i~fo~mat iotnhe trial provided conceriled the outcome of the crop under the existing soil and weather conditions. The mixture was seedecl on June 16, 1949-a few days after the sweet clover hacl been turilecl under on the adjacent plot area. On September I, yield data was obtained by harvesting four measured rectangles at different locations within the area-two where the crop was poorest, and two where it was best. In the poor places the yield averaged 1 ton per acre, while in the better places it was 2.5 tons. A chemical analysis of the hay showcd it to eontain 9.6 per-cent protein. It should bc noted that in this experiment with the oat-field-pea mixture, the crop did not have the benefit of a green-manure treatment. But in practice, as a detail which might be necessary in the scheme t o get organic matter into the soil, it woulcl of course be grown on land where sweet clover had been plowecl under. It is reasonable to assume that uilclcr that circuinstallce the hay yield would be appreciably increased, just as was the barley yielcl on the regular plot series where sweet clover was turnecl uilcler in June, 1949 (see Table 3) .

Several of tlle trcatments applied on this field in the spring of 1948, for the potato crop, produced large and very profitable increases in yield. Barlcy was seeded on the plot area in the spring of 1949, and early in tlie season it was apparent that some of the treatments which had been applied in the potato experiment were hay-ing a marlred residual effect on the barley. The barley was harvested on August 19, 1949. The 1.esults are shown in Table 4. It woulcl appear that residual phosphate was the major factor in boosting the barley yield, for in every case in which there was a significant increase, phosphate had been an iiigreclieiit of the treat-ment applied in 1948. All of the significant illcreases were of the same order, ranging from 26.8 to 35.1 bushels, with no significant difference between any two of them. It scems reasonable to suppose that not a great deal of the nitrogen applied in the spring of 1948 was left for use by the barley, as the preceding potato crop uildoubtedly drew heavily upon that nitrogen supply. If tllere was not much residual nitrogen from that application, then the beneficial effect of Treatment No. 3-the N, P-on the barley must bc ascribecl mainly to residual phosphate from it. Similar reasoning applies to the other four treat-meilts which supplied nitrogen and phosphate. And, the fact that no one of these other four gave an increase significantly diflerent from that produced by Treatment No. 3-altllough one of them supplied potash, two of them sulfur, and one of them gypsum-suggests that it was the phosphate they contained, and not the other materials, which accounted for their effectiveness on the barley crop. MUNK FIELD, PERSHINC) COUNTY Location. In the Lower Loveloclc Valley, about nine miles south of Loveloclr, on the farm of Mr. Harry A. Mlmk. Xoil. The whole profile (to five-foot depth) is clay; the surface 18-inch layer is medium gray in color, quite clarlr when wet; from there, the color changes to light gray, and then to very light gray, with depth. Reaction (pH) values range from 9.2 at the surface to 9.5 at the five-foot depth. Discussion. The same treatments which had been applied on this field in the spring of 1948 wcre repeated in the spring of 1949, and spring wheat (Big Club) was again planted on the plots, In 1948 there had beell some significant increases in the wheat yields, due to treatments, but none of them were very large. Frost damage early in July had rendered the results inconclusive in that season; and the average yield for the whole field was only 34.6 bushels per acre, whereas in 1949 it was 58.9 bushels. The results for tlie 1949 season are presentecl in Table 5. An inter-esting point to be notecl there is the result from Treatment No. 3, which was phosphate without any other elements. It gave a yield increase esselltially as large as was obtained from several of the treat-inents which supplicd other nntrient elenients i11 combination with phosphate. (Compare Treatment No. 3 with Treatments Nos. 4, 5, 7, aucl 9.) This suggcsts that the Munlc field soil is less in need of nitro-gen tliaii of phosphate; or at least that was the condition during the 1949 season. The soil on this field is darlcer in color than the soils on ANNUAL REPORT BOARD OF CO +lWmSIPI-MAl-CCI*.+Q Y?'? "?

This finding on tlie MunB field this year is the first instance we have encountered, i11 these experiments, in which phosphate alone was as effective as the nilrogen-phosphate combination. Ilo~vever we do not bclieve it nrould be safe to conclude, merely 011 the basis of this one result, that there is no problem of nitrogel1 supply, or that there will be no such problem, 011 this liilld of land. 011 the contrary we feel it is probable that, as tlie phosphate reserve is built up, nitrogen addition will be a factor in the lnaiiltelialice of fertility. Tlie costs of the treatnient for tlie 1948 crop are iiot shown in Table 5, bnt were listed in last year's report. l'rices for trcatmei~tm aterials in 1949 were about the same-a little higher in sonie cases-as in 1948. A snniniary, for tlie two years, or the profit or loss figures reveals that olily four of the tyeatmenLs procluced ally pl.ofit during tliat period. These are Treatinents Nos. 3, 4, 10, anti 13; Ihcir respective natures, and the acre retnrns they gave, arc as f o l l o ~:~ ~psh osphate, $5.53 ; nitrogen plus pltospliate, $5.16; manure, $5.59; aiid phosphate plus manure, $11.23. All the other niatcrial treatments resulted in losses, which rangecl front $10.46 for the "N, P, I<" to $173.59 for the "N, P, IC + I-I,SO,." Sweet clover liad been sercled with the wheat, 011 all but the No-Treatment plots. A good s t a ~ ~ocfl clover came np, bnt was severely damaged by hail about May 17, 1949. On June 16 the clover stand appeared too thin, so on that clatc the plot area was reseeded with white, lsieiiiiial sweet clovcr. A satisl'aclory stand resulted. I n the spring of 1950 tllc treatment scheme on tliis field ~vasm odified somewhat, to perillit the trial of certaiii treatments which had not been included i11 the experiment during the first two years. The nature of these chan~esa, nd the reasons Cor them, are tlescribed below. The results with the "N" treatment (nitrogen alonc ; l'reatnient No. 2) in 1948 and 1949 clearly showed its ineffectiveness. IIence it was decided to nse those particular plots to try, on this fielcl, the "N + Sul-fur" treatment n.Ilich hncl proved cluitc effective 011 some of the other fields. Prior to plowing the field, the sweet clover was tllerefore removed from those plots, ancl the "N +Sulfur" combillation was applied to them. Former Treatment No. 4 (N, P) was cl~anged to phospliate alone, but in a greater amount than had been added in the N, P colnbiiiation in the preceding two years. It was desired to see whether this heavier phosphate application, together witli the residual phosphate left in the soil from the N, P treatment applied i11 1948 and 1949, would have a beneficial effect on tlie alfalfa crop ull~irh was to bc cstablishecl in 1950. Hence, the sweet clover was removcd from thc plots concerned, and treble superphosphate at tlie rate of 500 pouncls per acre was applied. No nitrogen was inclltdecl witli this pl~osphnte application. The inability of s~llfnric acid lo incrrase yiclds had been demon-strated i11 1948 ancl 1949. The plots which hat1 received that treatment (Treatment No. 14) were therefore used in 1950 to show the effect of green manure. No sulfuric acid was applied to these plots, in 1950. One of the plots had a poor stand of sweet clover, but on the other three plots the stand was good. ANNUAL REPORT BOARD OF CONTROL 47 The original Treatment No: 10, barnyard manure, was continued in 1950. The sweet clover was removed from the plots concerned, and a manure at the rate of 8 tons per acre was applied, as it had been in 1948 and 1949. On the No-Treatment plots, sweet clover had not bceri clrilled with the mhcat, when tlie latter was planted. I-Iowever, the second seeding of sweet clover, to get a better stand, was broadcast with a cyclone seeder, and so tlie clover was established on all the plots. The clover was removed from the No-Treatment plots, in the spring of 1950, before the field was l)lowecl aiid prepared for seeding alfalfa. Ranger alfalfa, with n inirse crop of barley was seeded 011 the field on J ~ m e15 , 1950. QUILICI FIELD, PERSHING COUNTY Locrction,.

F ~ + omth ere clown to a t least 50 inches, the soil is ligl~t gray clay. From the surface down through the entire profile, the pT-I valucs vary olily between 8.9 and 9.2. Discussion. Tlie potato crop is one which is commonly recopizecl as having a relatively high potash requirement, and in most potnto-grolvi~ ig arcas the fertilizers used for this crop carry a. liberal nmotint of potasli, as well as nitrogen aiid phosphate. In Nevada many potato growers Iiave bee11 sccustomecl to using the 16-20-0 grade, commonly referred to as "sixteen-twenty." This fertilizer, as its formula indi-cates, supplies no potash. From the fact tliat farmers have used it ood deal, there can be no doubt that it has been more or less cffective llcreasing potato yields. I-Iowever, its use in Nevacla did not develop on the basis of experimental evidence that it was better for potatoes than a fertilizer carrying potash, too; in fact, there had been no experi-ments, on Nevada soils, which would determine the relative merits of these two types of fertilizer. It was therefore essential to obtain clefi-nite illformation on tliis point ; hence, in our experiments with potatoes, ne of t l ~ eob jcct,ives is to compare the perFormance of an N, P fertilizer it11 that of au N, P, K, or "complete," grade. The experimeilt with potatoes on the McQowan-Meffly fleld in 1948 (described in last year's report) showed a very marked difference between tlie cffccts of the N, P and the N, P, R treatments, in favor of the latter. Thc nitrogen-phosphate fertilizer did not increasc the yielcl significantly over No-Treatment; but the nitrogen-phospliate-potash treatment gave an increase of 3.73 tons par acre. The N, P treat~ncnt consisted of 400 pounds, per acre, of 16-20-0. The N, PI K trcatnlcnt supplied tlie sarne amounts of N ailcl P as the 16-20-0, but add it ion, snfficient potash to mnlre the formula 16-20-24. In the present experiment, on the Q~zilici field, Trcntmenta Nos. 2 and 3 (N, P and N, P, I<, ~espectively) were identical with tlie two described in the preceding pa~agraph. The results UP this experiment 'ADA AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION w -".. 3 3 -" c e 6. 5 9 d ffl m a I1 II I1 II c mg .Md C VI L 0 ffl I '- fl. f c g A 4 u 1I C L ANNUAL REPORT BOARD OF CONTKOL 49 are show11 in Table 6. In this instance both N, P and N, P, K definitely increased yields and showed very appreciable profits. The difference between the two increases, however, is not nearly up to the amount required for significance ; and this seems to indicate that the inclusion of potash in a fertilizer for this soil is not essential. Further support for this view may be found in the performance of Treatment No. 5 which contained elemental sulfur. We have previously called attention to eases in which the inclusion of sulfur in a treatment, with other materials which by tliernselves (i. e., without the sulfur) were very effective in illcreasing yields, prevented the beneficial action of tliose n~ateriills. Comparison of the yield froin Treatment No. 5 wit11 that froill Treatment No. 3 reveals another case of that lrind; the yield froin "N, P, Ii + Sulfur" was 48.6 saclrs less than from "N, P, I<." It is felt that the adverse effect of the sulfur in this instance may have been dnc to ail unbalanced nutrient co~~di t ioinnd ucecl by an excessive s u l) ~ l yof ~beaclily absorbable potassium, which was clissolved out of soil n ~ i ~ ~ ~byr asul lsfu ric acid formrd b y oxidation of the sulfur. I f , as has been snggestecl above, this soil already contains a sufficient sup-ply of clieinicaily available potash for crop needs, then an appreciable increase ill the supply might result in enough of an excess to upset the nntrierit bttla~ice. The sulfur ill Treatinellt No. 4 may have had the same kiiicl of effect. Tlic difference between the yielcls from "N, P" and "N, P + Sulfur" is not as large a8 the last significant difference, but it is almost four-fifths RS milch, a i d this may be one of the exceptional cafies iiz which an effect was actually significaut although not shown to be so by the statistical nl~nlysis of tlle tluta.

TVorlr undertalcen under this project by the Nevacla Agricultui-a1 Ex1,rrirnent Station during the past year covered two phases; tltc circulation of a mail questionnaire covering producers' experiences with auction mnrlcets in Nevada; and the colupletion of tlic samplc~ survey, begun in tlie spring of 1949, of all mnrketing pl-i~cticcs oS producers in Nevada and portiolls of California a i ~ dO 1.egon. Over 800 auction marlcet mail questionnaires were scnt o11t to ~) i ~ o - ducers over the State. A good response nlm secured, with n~tuly of tlic. respoi~dents adding informative cornmerits to their rrplies -to clireclt questions. There is much interest in this rapidly gro~vi~aignt 1 evolving metl~od of marlteting livestock. Nearly all the Stntr except the southern part is within the sci~vicr 50 NEVADA AQRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION area of local auction markets, inside or outside the State. A good part of this service, especially to the more distant patrons, is provided indirectly by dealers operating on the markets. While the auction8 provide many of the smaller producers with the best education on prices and bargaining they have ever had, many producers are reluctant to take the risk of wide price variations which frequently occur and therefore sell through dealers who are able to spread the rislr over many transactions. Larger producers use the local auctions mostly to dispose of culls and odds and ends. The information on auction marlrets from all the cooperating States is being analyzed at a central place. Several publications which will contain findings leading to improvements in the development of live-stoclr auction markets are in preparation. The work done this year brings the number of direct interviews of cattle producers of all sizes to about 200, including 40-odd taken in adjacent feeder cattle producing areas in northeastern California and southeastern Oregon, Analysis of tlie interviews from 1,200 small to medium-size operators talren i11 all cooperating States is in progress at Laramie, Wyoming. Study of 52 interviews talren throughout the region from operators with 2,000 or more cattle is under way at the Nevada Agricultural Experiment Station. Two important observations gained from the interviews talcen by our staff in the three States are the trend toward more rapid development and heavier fleshing of young beeves by producers, and the develop-ment of the practice of selling on the basis of carcass grade and weight. Both of these developments are evidence of the desire of producers to eliminate shortcomings of the traditional marlteting machinery. A rather notable reaction found among the more progressive producers was the feeling that the grower of high-grde cattle was not adecluately rewarded by price differentiation related to cluality of cat,tlc sold alive. This situation worlrs against all educational efforts to improve prociuc-tion methods. Work done so far on marketing practices ol large producers rein-forces the impressioll that one of the biggest problems of small pro-ducers is assembly of the product into large enough lots to attract really competitive bidding, Another possibly important observation is that very little of the product of larger operations west of the Roclries, which region is a large proportion of total production in this area, passes through public markets. This fact, along with other related knowledge, raises questions about the efficiency of the function of prices in regulating prodnction under such conditions.

With the coop-eration of five retail marlrets in Reno, a stucly was made of consumer ANNUAL REPORT BOARD OF CONTROL 5 1. reaction to the offering of turkey meat cut into halves, quarters, and smaller pieces during the period from November 15, 1948, to January 15, 1949. During this period, sales efTort by the marlrets was stimulated b y protection against losses and a subsidy of $1 per bird for those cut into pieces. This was followed up in December, 1949, and January, 1950, by observation of any tendency to continue the sale of turkey parts. All reported sales of halves in excess of the numbers sold in 1948-1949, but neither quarters nor pieces were offered for sale in any of these shops. Meat cutters quoted many of their customers as say-ing, after trying a half-turkey, that they preferred a large turkey cut in half to a smdl bird, Full details of this study were published in t h e mimeographed report, "Consumer Demand for Turlrey P a r t s i n Eetail Marlrets in Reno, Nevada, November 15, 1948, to January 15, 1949." Consumer reaction was almost unanimously favorable, md the results, although quantitatively insignificant, are believed to indicate an impor-t a n t potential outlet for large turkeys in addition to the usual storage demarld for such birds. The tracle response was somewhat less enthnsi-astic than that of consllnlers ; it indicated that considerable publicity is lilrely to be reqnirecl il t~ large volume of sales is secured. The volume of sales was restrictecl by the high prices for turkeys that pre-vailecl during the 1948-1949 season, as well as by unfamiliarity on t h e part of customers with the product in cut-up form. Conclzuions. a. From the consunler standpoint cut-up turkey is a good product. It is ready to cook when purchased; it is adapted to many methods of preparation, including incorporation with less expen-sive foods in meat-stretching dishes ; it is relished by most pcoplc ; and it call be priced in line with other comparable meats or meat proclucts. b. Distribution of cut-up turlrey can both broaden and deepen the rnarlret for turkey. The use of turlrey can be extended to persons who would not buy whole birds, and additional sales can be made to con-sumers who now buy turkey only once or twice a year. c. Expansion of sales of half- and quarter-turlrcys promises to reduce the discouiit that has heretofore existed on large tom turkeys during holiday periods. d. It is likely to require intensive salts effort, supported by organized producers or processors ancl continued over a period oP several yenrci, t o expand sales of cut-up tnrlwy to any important extent in the smaller cities ancl t o ~ n s . 2. Relation, of Weights of Parts of Turkcys to Weighis After Cook-ing. The purpose of this project was to determino the amount of eclible meat on turlrcys of vnrious sizes nncl the effect of size on the weight of leg meat, wing meat, breast meat, dark meat, and giblets. Twenty broad-bremtccl Bronze tom turlceys were ~veigliecl before eviscerating, aiid after eviscerating. They were then cut into pieces and weiglits were tnlreii 011 each individual bird for the vnrious pieces hefore coolring. After tlie tnrlrey pieces were roasted, the indiviclurd parts were weighed; the11 the meat was cut from the bone ancl the weight of the edible meat on each part was obtained. I11 a part of a similar cxperirnelit oondncted in 1947, 20 Bronze tor~ls were roasted as whole birds in contrast to the roasting of cat-up pieces in 1949. 52 NEVADA AGRICZJLTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION There was over a two-pound loss in the birds coolced in pieces as cornpared to those coolced as whole birds. This cannot be accounted for except that since the birds used in 1949 were much fatter than those in 1947 there was probably an increase in the amouilt of melted fat.' Both lots were roasted at 300'. Neither moisture nor fat remain-ing in the pans alter roasting was weighed in either year. The amount of melted fat in birds could be an important factor, for if there is con-siderable fat in the heavier birds it would cut down on the percentage of edible meat. While turlrey fat is excellent for many purposes in cooking, the price per pouilcl of turlrey fat might be rather high. 3. Marketing Turlceys Tl~rouglz Prozcn Pood Locke~ Plants. Pre-liminary worlr was done on this project to determine the possibility of expanding the outlet for large turkeys by storage in cut-up form in loclrer plants and home freezers. Seventeen locker plant operators in Western Nevada and Central California were interviewed early in November. A questionnaire was compiled to obtain inforinatio~l on the number of lockers in each plant, - type of service supplied, possibility of cooperation on merchandising large storage birds to patrons of loclrers, and previous amount of stor-age of turlceys. Operators of several locker plants in the vicinity of Reno agreed to cooperate by having turlrey available for sale for storage in frozen food loclrers. A mailing list of all patrons of three Reno, Sparlcs, and Carson City locker plants and of all purchases of home freezers from local dis-tributors was compiled for a survey of consumer reaction to be con-ducted later in 1950. PnoJEcrr 71-Rescarch and Marketing Pund, Adjz~stnzents in 'Market-ing of Ranch and Range Cattle. 1947-Continuous. Proj-ect Leader, I-Ioward G. Mason. The principal objective of this study is to determine how the feed and forage resources of the State can be most eEciently and economi-cally utilized in the production of those classes of cattle now most in demand, or in growing demand, in West Coast, markets. It is common knowledge that illcreasing numbers of calves and short yearlings are desired for stoclring a rapidly increasing acreage of irri-gated pastures in the central valleys of California. There also seems to be an increasing teiidency toward operation on a stocllrer steer basis in Nevada. These trends or tendeilcies see111 to open the way toward more specializatioii by prodycers for marketing different classes of cattle at different seasons of. the year. Such variation in marketing programs also permits adjustment to the rather wide variation in the organization or setup of Nevada ranches with respect to seasonal range, pasture, and harvefited crops. One of the chief obstacles to cllangc in ranch operations is lack of lcnowledge about the reliability of, or outlook for, price differentials between age classes of cattle for diffcreilt seasons of the year. Infor-mation on these points is being accumulated from marketing statistics and from local traders, feeders, and shippers. Several thousand head of Nevada cattle are being purchased annually oil the basis of carcass weight and grade. This unique operation is ANNUAL ItEPORT UOARD OF CONTROL 53 being studied in comparison with common marketing practices in the same area. PROJE7C0-TR esearch and !Marketing Fund. Production and Murket-ing of Tonzato l'ransplants in Southern Nevada. 1947- Continuous. Project Leader, M, R. Miller, assisted by John Wittwer and V. E. Spencer. Experimental plantings were made of tomatoes in an attempt to obtain additional information on the following problems : (1) The development of methods for controlling annual weeds with an emergent spray. (2) Pruning of tomato plants which become too large for transplant use prior to the time of harvesting and shipping. (3) The effect of fertilizer placement on size aud quality of tomato plants at shipping time. WEED UONTROL The control of weeds is a never-ending problem in the production of tomato plants. Many methods have been used to lessen the cost of wecd control, but the cost of the operation is still excessively high. There were 20 beds used in the weed control study. Each bed was 375 feet long and contailled two rows plantecl to seeds of the Moscow variety. The purpose of using such a large number of plants was to malre conditions as near commercial field conditions as possible. It is necessary to irrigate tomato seed for germination and growth and frequently it is not possible to have the ground dry enough to use a tractor and sprayer at the optimum time for controlling weeds. The period within which effective pre-emergent weed control can be prac-ticed is relatively short, thereby making it necessary to do all of the control work during a one- or two-day period. Two irrigations were necessary to germinate the tomato seed. Since weather conditioils were such that the tomato plants were ready to emerge before the gromd was sufficiently dry to permit use of a tractor, a hand spraying outfit was required. The spray treatments used were as follows: (1) Check, no treatment; (2) 50 gallons fuel oil per acre; (3) 100 gallons fuel oil per acre; (4) 50 gallons fuel oil plus one pint of a general weed lriller ; (5) 100 gaIlons of fuel oil plus one pint of a general weed killer; and (6) 50 gallons of water plus one pint of 2,4-D. (Acid equivalent 39 percent.) Because of the cold, baclrward spring the weeds did not germinate sooner than the tomatoes. Therefore, the weed control tests were not entirely conclusive, but it was noted that an 80 to 90 percent kill was obtained on the weeds that had emerged at the time of the spraying. ULIPPINC) The clipping of tomato plants has been a subject for much discussion. The object of clipping the plants is to control the size and harden the plants. Some of the objections to clipping tomato plants are: (1) . Possible danger of spreading virus diseases, (2) retarding the growth of the plants so that fruit harvest is made later, and (3) decreasing the yield by too severe clipping. The clipping studies this year involved the following treatments: (1) Plants were clipped severely; i, e., from four to six inches of the 54 NEVADA AQIZICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION plant were removed; (2) plants were slightly clipped once; i. e., one to one and one-half inches were clipped off; (3) plants were clipped slightly twice, at a one-week interval, about one inch each clipping; and (4) plants were prevented from getting too large by witllliolding water. The clipping 01 the plants was cloile by using a small mower with a three-Eoot cutter bar. Usually i11 about three or four days after clip-ping, new shoots were commencing to grow. The plants wliich were clipped became finer, and tlieir roots were more elongated thaii those on tlie plants that were ilot clippecl. It was also possible to place more oE the clipped plants in a standard size shipping crate than was the case with the tulclipped plants. Plants receiving the several different treatineilts were sent to the Utah State Agricultural Experiment Station. At thc B:~rmington farm the plants were grown out ancl yield dala talten. l'lants tcsted out at the Utah Station were as follows: severely clipped, slightly clippecl, oversize plants, normal plants (that is, as near TJ. S. No. 1 as could be obtained), and plants that hacl been relarcled by witllliolding water. The yield was greatest and the morlality rate lowcst, ill the so-called normal plailts that hacl not been clipped. I'lants which had been retarded by withholding water yielded a little more fruit, but had a slightly higher plant mortality. Plants wliich were oversize gave a low yield and a high plant mortality. The severely clipped plants had the lowest yield ancl the highest plant mortality. The plabts that had been but slightly clipped were comparable to the normal plants and to the plants wliich liacl been retarded by withholding water. FERTILIZER PLACEMENT TRIALS Worlr of the two previous years has inclicated rather definitely what kinds and amounts of fertilizers are needed to produce a profit-able crop. However, no worlr had been done to find out the best method of applying the fertilizer. The niethocls most commonly used in the production of tomato plants are : (1) Broadcasting the ferti-lizer on the surface of the grouncl, followed by harrowing to obtain a light coverage of the fertilizer. (2) Broadcasting the fertilizer and then discing it in to a depth of four to six inches. These first two methods are used most frequently in the application of phosphate fertilizers. (3) Banding in the fertilizer at time of seeding. (4) Side dressing which is usually used in applying nitrogen fertilizers. The placement trials were limited to the use of a phosphate fertilizer. The fertilizer was appliecl: (1) On the surface, (2) discecl under to a depth of four to six inches, and (3) baiicled about two inches below the seed. The phosphate was also applied in varying amounts. There were four replications of each treatment, randomized as to location. The plants on thc plots which were fertilizer1 showed an almost immediate response as indicated by a more rapicl growth than that of the plants on the checlc plots. As the growing seasoil advanced the plots which had been fertilized on the surface ancl those on which the fertilizer had been disced under appeared to procluce plants of about equal vigor and height. The plants on the plots on which the ferti-lizer had been banded were somewhat slower in getting started but ANNUAL REPORT BOARD OF CONTROL 55 caught up with the plants on the other fertilized plots as the season progressed. May 11 was selected as an arbitrary shipping date on which the different plots were examined to determine which treatments produced the greatest number of plants that would meet the specifications of a U. S. No. 1 plant. The grading results showed that all of the fertilizer treatments were equal for all practical purposes. The unfertilizecl plots, understandably, did not produce as large a number of U. S. No. 1 plants as did the fertilized plots. Conclusions which may be clrawn from the one year of fertilizer placement trials are that discing the fertilizer under was no more effective than leaving it on the s~trfacca, nd that banding the fertilizer was not superior to broadcasting it. IIowever, where the fertilizer was banded and where the amount of phosphate was halved, tlie plant rcsponsc was as good as where larger amounts were used. This would indicate that a saving could be made through the application of the phosphate fertilizer by banding, if the ecluipment for bailding was available. These results also indicate that there would be no aclvantage in spending the cxtra time, money, and effort that would be necessary to disc the fertilizer down into the soil.

The suminer of 1949 w!f4 spent in obtaining equipment necessary to begin actual field investl-gations by the beginning of the crop year 1950. Standard Class A evaporation stations were established at Krloll Creek Experiment Station, near Contact, Nevada; Monpn Vnllry; Upper Carson Valley; and the AgriculturaI Experiment Station Farm, Reno, Nevada. Irrig-a tion studies are planned f o r thcse nrean at a future date. Four 3' x 6' double consumptive-use tanks were installed at the I ~ I W Farm ancl seeded two to a ;aslure niix of alfalfa, b r o r n c h , ~ ~an~d, fescue, and two to young alfalfa transplants.

This was continuecl f o r several days until all free water was removed from the soil leaving it at fielcl capacity. 'In order to maintain a moist seed bed, frequent two- rtnd three-inch irrigations were applied. An inventory of tllc scwscrnwl watcr application will be lrept and at thc end of the season tlio mi1 will again be brought to field capacity.

From these data we were able to determine the amount of water in the soil prior to irrigation. Soil samples were again taken two days after irrigation when the soil was at field capac-ity. The same process of weighing, . drying, and computations was followed to determine the amount of water retained in the soil. The difference between the amount applied to the field and the amount retained in the soil was the amount lost by deep percolation. Data from these two series of soil samplings was used to determine the amount of water actually used by the crops. This work will bc con-tinued through the crop year to get an anilual use of irrigation water by alfalfa and to determine field irrigation efficiencies. Publication was completed of L'Consumptive Use of Irrigation Water by Crops in Nevada," Bulletin No. 185 of the Nevada Agricultural Experiment Station. This bulletin shows the extreme conditions of water use prevalent in Nevada. In the northeast corner of the State the computed consumptive use of irrigation water by alfalfa is 12 inches, while in the southeast corner it is 52 inches.

Very 'respectfully, 4 DIRECTOR'S REPORT. RENO, Nevada, Nov. 26, 1890. The Board of Control of the Nevada Agricultural Experiment Station: GENTLEMEN: Herewith is submitted my report as Director of the. Experiment Station, accompanied by the reports of the various membel's of the Station Staff and the financial statement of the Treasurer. These reports contain statements of work, done in the years of 1889 and 1890. In 1889 but little land was available for experi­mental purposes. This, however, was used to the best advantage as the report of the Agriculturist and Horticulturist will show. Last March I made a requisition for certain lands belonging to the State and succeeded in obtaining for the use of the Station 29.4 acres. So much labor was necessary.to properly prepare the ground for experiment that it was late before the seeding could be done. Many of the experiments were a success while some were a failure. ~mong other things which are especially claiming attention at the Station is the finding of some grass or forage plant which can be successfully grown in this arid country. Four bulletins have been issued during the year on the following subjects: No.8, "The Codling Moth;" No.9, "A Serious Rose Pest;" No. 10, "The Pear and Cherry Slug;" No. 11, "Plant Lice Infesting the Apple.". Prof. W. S. Devol, Agriculturist and Horticulturist, severed his connection with the Station June 30th. Since that time the duties of that position have devolved upon the Director and Botanist. From letters received and inquiries made I am convinced that the Station is attracting attention to the work done here and exerting an influ­ence in the State. Very respectfully, S. A. JONES, Director. 5 FINANCIAL REPORT Of the Nevada Agricultural E-vperiment Station. Receipts: Appropriation by U. S.

Three-fourths of an acre of stiff clay soil were given to experi­ments in the growth of varieties of grasses and forage plants. The ground had been in use as an alfalfa field and was with difficulty prepared for seeding. It was practically impossible to remove all the alfalfa roots in season for proper seeding at the first date. The ground was put in fairly good condition, without the appli­cation of manures, however, and on the first of May most of the seeding was done. The area was divided into thirty plots, each 7 two rods square, containing one fortieth of an acre each. One row of six plots could not be prepared for seeding until June 10, as a sewer was being laid through the section. Upon these plots twenty-eight varieties of grasses and forage plants were sown, and four varieties of lawn and meadow mixtures, two of the plots being divided into halves. . Few questions are of greater practical importance to Nevada ranchmen than that of forage for cattle, sheep and horses. The live-stock interest in the State has become second to none. When an abundance of water can be obtained for irrigation it is known that bountiful harvests of forage can be. grown. The yields of alfalfa are often enormous. Can equally large crops of so valuable a plant of some other variety be grown and wi~hout requiring so much water? It may be possible to obtain such a plant, and if it should be done it would add millions to the wealth of our State. It will require a number of years' careful experimenting to answer this question, and at the ExperiInent Station is the place it must be done. Following is a list of the grasses and other forage plants sown in 1889: Texas Blue Grass, Poa m·achnifera. Blue Grass, Poa pratense. Fowl nleadow Grass, Poa se1'otina. 'Vood lVfeadow Grass, Poa nem­oralis. Red Top, Agrostis vulgarris. Creeping -Bent Grass, Agrostis stolonifera. Orchard Grass, Ag1'ostis glomerata. Timothy, Phleum pratense. Italian Rye Grass, Lolium italicwm. Perennial Rye Grass, Loli'Hm pCl'enne. :Meadow Fescue, Festgca pratense. 'raller Fescue, Festuca elatior. Red Fescue, FestltCa 1'Ltb1'a. Tall Meadow Oat Grass, Avena elatior. nleadow Foxtail, Alopecu1'lts pratensis. Bernluda Grass, Oynoden dactylon. Velvet Grass, Iiolcus lanatlts. Johnson Grass, Smyh7./.;m halopense. Sweet Vernal Grass, Anthoxanthum odoratum. Hungarian Grass, Sitm'ia italica. Golden nfillet, Sitaria italica. Pearl lVlillet, Penicellarria- spicata. Red Clover, Trifolium pra~ense. White Clover, Prifoli'ltm rrepens. Alsike Clover, Prifolium hyb1·id~m. Japan Clover, Lespideza spicata. Spike Clover, Sweet Clover, Melolotus alta. Alfalfa Luzerne, iJ'Iedicago sativa. Espercette-Burnet, Onobrychis sativa; Seradella, Ornithopus sativus. Following are descriptive notes and observations made on the varieties and growth here last year and during the spring of 1890: Poa arachnifera (Texas blue grass). The specific name, arachni­fera, of this variety COlnes from the profuse hairiness of the flower and ~eeds. The web was so abundant about the seeds sowed that it was with difficulty that they could be separated sufficiently to seed well. It is a native of Texas, and is there a fine grass for 'winter pasture, growing more luxuriantly and larger than Kentucky blue or June grass. It is grown from seeds and divisions of roots. It sends out numerous stolons, or offshoots, and spreads rapidly by these nleans. There is reason to believe that this may be found to be a valuable pasture grass for many portions of the State. The 8 few stalks that came up bloomed early this year ~t a heighth of two feet, and the seed ripened the first week in June. Poa pratcn8is (June Grass, Blue Grass, Kentucky Blue Grass). This is the most widely distributed and best known of the orchard grasses. Few if any of the other grasses thrive so well under close grazing and continuous tramping by the stoqk. It forms a very close, compact sward, and remains green and growing throughout the sumlner and fall months, and even in winter. For these reasons it is a most valuable grass for lawns. It does not stand drougth well, and for this reason is not a desirable grass. for localities where water can not be got. It thrives best in a limestone soil, but may be grown successfully on soil of almost any character, so it be of moderate fertility. It is found native in most parts of the United States and Europe. The average height of this grass is one and one­half to two feet, but it varies from a few inches to three or four feet. It is not valuable for hay crops, as the stalks and leaves are too short and sparing at anyone time to afford a sufficiently abundant crop. It is one of the most nutritious of all grasses. The plot sowed April 23, 1889, did not bloom that season, but grew to be six inches tall. This season there is a good sward fonned and the stalks twelve to eighteen inches tall. Poa scrotina (Fowl Meadow Grass). This grass is a native of the eastern part of northern United States, and grows most profusely along river bottoms and where it is likely to be flooded occasionally. The stalks grow in favorable localities to a height of two to three feet, and are always soft and palatable to stock, so that it is fed without waste. It thrives in a variety of soils, but does best in rich, Inoist situations and takes congenially to other grasses in mixed seeding. It is highly nutritious and liked by cattle. It blooms a little late--about with Timothy-and produces an abundance of seed. It starts into growth after cutting, but slowly. It was planted here May 1, 1889, and made but very little growth the first season. This season there are no plants Jound living. Poa nemoralis (Wood Meadow Grass). Like the preceding, this grass does .best in moist situations, and is also a good grass to put in rather shaded localities, as in open forests and orchards. It is a perennial and the root stalk is creeping, something like Blue Grass. It grows about two feet tall and flowers in June, the seed ripening in July. It was planted in the Station grounds May 1, 1889, and Calne into bloom late in August at a height of eight inches. The fine, narrow blades were five inches long. This year (1890) it was in full bloom in the middle of June. Although there was but little water in the .plot and the growth light, the stalks reached a height of twelve to fifteen inches. Agrostis vulgaris (Red Top, Bent Grass). This is one of the best known of our native or wild grasses, flourishing in rich lands, espe­cially in wet situations. It has also been known to do fairly well in 9 dry and gravelly soils. After being started by"'seeds it spreads by means of creeping 'root-stalks, or stolons, formii;g a tough matt~d turf very much 'like that of Blue Grass. It is very nutritious, rank­ing almost with Blue Grass, and its chief value is a pasture grass. It was sown here April 23, 1889, and made but poor growth the first season. '1:'he average height was twenty-six inches, and the blades were one foot long. This season there is a good sward formed and the panicles began to protrude at a height of ten inches the second week in June. It is a hardy perennial and blooms with Timothy, or a very little later. Agrostis stolonifera (Creeping Bent Grass). This is a perennial grass, prostrate in habit, spreading rapidly by stolons, but requiring a great deal of water to start the seeds. The foliage is of a bright, lively green and produced in abundance, making it a desirablegrass for grazing. Like the last named it does best on low, moist ground, and is most desirable as a pasture grass on wet irrigated fields. At the Nebraska Station it is .considered valuable only for lawns, but the growth here last season and this, indicates a very valuable pasture grass where sufficient water can be secured. It was seeded June 10, 1889, and none came up except along the irrigating ditches in bunches. This season it spread rapidly early in the season and continued to cover the ground. By the 10th of June it was fifteen to eighteen inches, high and the panicles appearing. Dactylis glomerata (Or~hard Grass). This is a light green, per­ennial grass of a rough, coarse nature, growing from two to four feet tall. It starts into growth early in the spring, and blooms with red clover, hence is a most valuable grass to sow with red clover to support the latter. It grows remarkably well in shaded situations, whence the name "Orchard Grass." Unless seeded very thickly it gro'ws in dense clumps, or tufts, making a very object­ional feature. The growth of stems is not very abundant, but the growth of leaves is great. It is therefore a valuable pasture grass. It springs up very quickly:after cutting, and is a nutritious grass. It succe~ds best in a rather high locality, or in one well drained, artificially or naturally, as the blades are apt to be affected with rust in very wet situations. Part of a plot was seeded with this variety April 23, and part May 1st, 1889, and by the last of August there was no difference between the two seedings. No flowering stalks were produced, but a good even growth of leaves two feet long was obtained. This year there was a good uniform growth, two feet high in bloom June 10th. Phleum pl'l'atense (TiInothy). This is the commonest and most widely known of the hay grasses in the United States. It is a hardy perennial grass with fibrous roots and the base of the stalk usually enlarged into a bulbous mass. No other variety of grass is so gen­erally recognized by farmers, and there is but one variety-Meadow Foxtail-that is often mistaken for Timothy, but differs in general 2-A appearance in being of a shorter growth and the heads or spikes shorter and slightly' tapering. The stalks of Timothy are stiff, two to three feet tall, bearing few short flat leaves, which cure rather tough and do not break badly in handling. The proportion of stalk to leaves is large. The season of harvesting this grass for hay extends over a larger period than any other variety, for it makes valuable hay from the time of begin­ning to bloom until the seed is almost ripe. This is not a suitable grass for grazing, as it does not spring up quickly after being cut and close feeding injures the bulb-like enlargement at the base of the stalk, and eventually kills the plant. It was sown at the Station May 1, 1889, and made a spare growth. The average height of the scattering stalks was twenty-six inches, and of the blades from the roots one foot. The growth this season has been but little better. Lolium italicum (Italian Rye Grass). This variety of Rye Grass stands drought remarkably well,. and in many localities, especially in the South, takes the place of Timothy. It is a grass well suited to irrigated meadows, but has been known to be killed and rotted by a period of very wet weather followed by very hot weather. It is considered an annual in the Northern States, although when pas­tured or cut closely it lives from year to year. It is often injured by severe winters. In the South it is perennial, growing from two to four feet high. 'fhe leaves are long and slender and of a bright shining green color. The leaves and stalks are tender and animals are fond of it. It was sown here April 23; 1889, and made a fine heavy growth the first year. ~ This year the growth was fair, but variable, and it bloomed June 10th to 15th at a height of fourteen to twenty inches. The blades alone grew twenty-two inches long last season. Lolium pcrenne (Perennial Rye Grass). This is a species of which the former is by botanists frequently considered but a variety rather than a distinct species. Like the former it is frequently re­garded as an annual, or biennial in the northern and a perennial in the southern United States. Both species seed very abundantly. The blades of this are somewhat narrower than are those of the Italian rye grass. It was sown ·upon the Experiment Station grounds May 1, 1889 and made a thick matted growth last year, but not equal to the Italian. It reached an average height of twelve inches. This season it did not grow'" so tall nor cover the ground so well as the Italian rye. It has this:season.a reddish cast about the base of the stalks. The average height, June 10, 1890 was ten to twelve inches. Festuca. pratense (Meadow Fescue). By some botanists this and the following are regarded as but varieties of one species. This is a perennial, growing from: Ii to 2i feet tall, with usually nod­ding panicles. The leaves are broad and flat. It is one of·the standard grasses of Europe and is now being quite extensiv~ly 11 grown in the northeastern United States. It thrives on a variety of soils and does well in both moist and dry situations. It starts early in the spring and ripens its seed early, producing it in abund­~ nce. Pur.e seed ?f this is obtained with difficulty, for, as a rule, it IS badly nuxed wIth rye grass seed. May 1, 1889, it was sown !lere, and made a fine m~tted growth. 'Vhen sown in the spring ~t produces but few flowerIng stalks. These reached a height of 26 Inches. The leaves were 16 inches tall. This season it made a fair growth and was in bloom June 10, at a height of eighteen inches to two feet. It is a livelier green than Tall Fescue, but not so thick on the ground nor so tall. Festuca clatior (Tall Fescue). 'fhis is a perennial grass, growing to a height of two to four feet, usually tufted or growing in clumps, or bunches, becOluing higher each year.' The blades grow from one to two and one-half feet long. The roots are tough and fibrous and the nodding panicle luuch like chess or cheat, but rather slender. It is eaten with avidity by cattl~, both when gro,ving and when cured as hay. It is taller and of a duller color than Meadow Fescue, and sometillles two crops of this are cut in one season. At the Experiment Station a plot was seeded on the 23d of April, 1889, and it made a fine matted growth that season, but ,produced no flowering culms. The blades grew two feet long. This season it . has lllade a large and unifoflll growth; height two feet to thirty­three inches. In bloom about the 1st of June. Festuca 'rubra (Red Fescue). This is a perennial European grass growing two to three feet tall. It seems to be suited to dry sandy or gravelly soils, as it stands drought pretty well. It is not valuable as a Iueadow grass as it grows in tufts, and the leaves are all near the ground and short. 'rhe stalks and many of the leaves have a reddish color, whence the name. It was sown on the Station grounds April 23d, and but few flowering stalks were produced the first season, reaching but twelve inches in height. It is badly mixed with Rye Grass and other varieties. The growth this season was twelve to fifteen inches. Seed ripe June 12th. Avena clatio1' (Tall Meadow Oat Grass). This is a perennial grass . growing frol11 three to five or even six feet in height and bearing panicles luuch like those of the common oat, only much more slender. It has a bitter taste which SOl11e say is disliked by cattle, while others say that cattle eat it with a relish. It produces leaves on the stalks freely. It is hardy and withstands drought remarkably well. It blooms early and ripens its seed quickly, so should be cut promptly. If penuitted to stand a day or two after blooming the stalks become woody and unpalatable. A plot was sown Ivfay 1, 1889 at the Station and a few flower stalks were produced, growing to a height of eighteen inches. The blades were one foot tall and this season itgrew two and one half to 12 three feet tall and was in bloom before the first of June. It is thin on the ground, but made an even growth over the plot. , Alopec'urus pratensis (Meadow Foxtail). This is a rather slender perennial growing one to two and one half feet tall, and resembling timothy in general appearance more nearly than any other grass commonly seen in the United States. The spike of meadow foxtail is shorter than that of timothy, broader in the middle, and tapering and is softer to the touch. It starts early in the spring and comes into bloom early in June, and the seeds on some of the spikes ripen before the middle of June while others remain green for a long time. The seed is very light and hard to procure pure. It thrives best in a very rich soil. A plot of this was sown here June 10, 1889 and but a few plants were obtained. June 10th, this year, a few heads were in bloom while others had ripe seed upon them. The plants were from fifteen to twenty inches tall. Cynodon dactylon (Bermuda Grass). This is a low perennial grass thriving luxuriantly in warm climates, and standing heat and drought well. The flowering stalks seldom reach a foot in height, hence is used for pasture only. It produces but little seed in the United States, but is propagated mostly by cutting up and sewing the jointed root stalks which are produced in abundance, spreading the grass with wonderful rapidity. When it has once gained a foothold it is with great difficulty that it ca~ be eradicated, the small pieces of root stalks being very tenacious 'of life, and .eacn piece broken and remaining in the soil will produce a n,ew plant. It thrives on rather poor soil and will bear close cropping and hard tramping. It was sown at the Station June 10, 1889, and made a good growth of fine, close leaves and a few stalks. This season it has formed a close compact, turf and close mat of leaves two to five inches tall. There are a number of brown leaves· mixed with the reddish green of the healthy plant. The flowering, stalks were from four to eight inches tall and the plant bloomed June 12th. HolcU8 lanatus (Velvet Grass, Meadow Soft ·Grass). A per­ennial grass, usually about a foot tall, but varying from one half to two feet tall. It derives its name from its 'soft, velvety character, due to a gray pubescence covering the entire plant. It has short, broad leaves and numerous flower stalks, the leaves, stems and . flowers having a reddish gray color. It is not very nutritious, and stock are not fond of it. A plot was sown May 1, 1889, and was in bloom August 28, 1889, at fourteen inches in height. The blades were eight inches tall. This season there was a good growth fifteen to twenty inches tall and in bloom before the middle ofJune, Sorghum halapense (Johnson Grass). This is a coarse perennial grass growing from three to six feet tall, the stalks one-fourth to one-half inches across. It is propagated by seeds and by divisions of the root stalk, and spreads by both these methods. Here it is 13 not perfectly hardy, most of the roots being killed during winter. In southern Nevada it will undoubtedly prove a valuable grass where water can be obtained. When once established in a locality it will. stand great heat and drought, and with a moderate supply of water may be cut once in four to six weeks during the growing season. NIay 1, 1889, one pound of seed was sown on a fortieth of an acre at the Station, the soil a stiff clay; August 22d it was cut, producing 139 pounds of dry hay. This year there are but a few scattering plants, most of it having been water-killed. Anthoxatum odoratum (Sweet Vernal Grass). This is a very small perennial grass, seldom more than a foot tall, sown in pasture, meadow and lawn for the agreeable odor it possesses. The growth is too lnenger to have any value aside from this. A plot was sown at the Station NIay 1, 1889, and a few plants produced, which grew to a height of four inches. This season it grew three to six inches tall, in tufts, and was in full bloom by the 10th of June. Setaria italica (Hungarian Grass). This is an annual of Asiatic origin and has been in cultivation for untold ages. It grows from two to four feet high, depending upon the character of the soil and amount of moisture. When sown thickly it makes a valuable hay, but if seeded thin it is too coarse. There are many varieties, this one having seeds, part of which are yellowish and part gray brown. A plot was seeded NIay 1, 1889, and made a vigorous growth, from which a good crop of seed was cut. Golden or German Millet is another variety of the same species, and this grows a little taller and has large heads of seeds, all of which are of a yellowish, straw color. A heavy crop of seed of this variety was obtained, also. The millets being annuals, are shallow feeders and luake use of manures spread upon the surface or but lightly raked in. Pennisitum specatum (Pearl Millet). This is not a millet proper. It is a coarse rank growing perennial under cultivation for many years in parts of the South;' but within a few years past has been extensively tried throughout the United States. It requires an abundance of heat and moisture, a rich soil and long season to make good crops. Two or three crops are cut in a season. It grows four to eight feet high; leaves three-fourths to one and one-half inches broad; stalks often nearly an inch through. It branches freely from near the surface of the ground. A plot was sown April 23, 1889, and NIay 1st, from which a moderate growth was obtained. August 27th it was cut, making 153 pounds of cured hay. It does not survive the winter here. Trifolinm prratense (Red Clover). The place of Red Clover, as well as all other lneadow grasses, is filled in Nevada by alfalfa. Yet Red Clo­ver proves a valuable forage plant in SOlne parts of the State. It ~as been recognized as a valuable plant for more than twenty centurIes, and has been under cultivation longer than any of the true grasses. 14 It is prized not only for the valuable hay it yields, but also as a crop to plow under green as a lnanure and for renewing the fertility of old worn out farms and for pastures. It is an annual, biennial or perennial, depending upon con­ditions. It grows from two to five feet, the rank growth often lodg­ing and spoiling. The roots penetrate to a great depth, thus loosening and iInproving the character of the soil, if it be a stiff one. A plot was seeded May 1, 1889, which made a fine even growth of two feet last season. August 30, 124 pounds of cured hay were harvested. This season most of the plot was without' water until in June, and the growth was light. It stands drought nearly as well as alfalfa. Trifolium repens (White Clover). This is a perennial clover, the smooth stem creeping and rooting at the joints. It is perfectly hardy 'in the United States, and starts into growth early in spring, and with a nlOderate amount of moisture, and it remains green until severe freezing in the fall. It germinates readily and it is eaiser to get a catch with this than with any other clover. Its chief value is for a pasture plant and for lawns; either sown alone .01' in a mixture with other grasses. A plot of this clover was sown here :May 1st, and a good even growth obtained last year, the stalks running sixteen inches. rrhis ,year about two thirds of the plot was left without water, and by the middle of June most of the clover was dead. 'Jlrifolium hybridum (Alsike Clover). This is a snlooth stemmed hardy perennial, between red and white clover in appearance. The stems grow one to two feet long, are weak and liable to lodge if . the growth is large. It thrives best in a rather clayey moist soil, but stands drought fairly well. It is considered a good pasture clover and is a favorite honey plant. The growth is larger after two or three years than at first. A plot was put in at the Station May 1, I 1889, and a good growth obtained the first year. This year but very little water was put on and the growth was very light-seven to ten inches tall June 10th, and in full bloom. Lespideza striata (Japan Clover). rrhis is a low perennial spread­ing along the surface of the ground, seldom rising more than two or three inches. The leaves are SIllall, close to the branches, and the flower inconspicuous; It is said to be a good plant to grow on poor sandy soil to prevent its washing or being swept by the wind, and that it will thrive in very dry situations. A plot was seeded with this May 1, 1889, and a few plants obtained. Although they were given plenty of water, the growth' was very light and every plant was killed by freezing during the winter. Mililotus alba (Spike Clover, Sweet Clover). This is an annual, or if started late, a biennial, growing from two to eight feet tall. The branches and stenlS are hard and wood and leaves very abund­, ant. Live stock eat it very sparingly in pasture, but sheep will eat 15- it cured with other plants as hay. The leaves and young branches emit a pleasant odor when bruised or when drying. It grows abundantly along the banks of streams, but does not thrive in dry situations. A plot was seeded June 10, 1889, and a few plants obtained which reached a height of three feet. The growth this season has not been very large. . l1fcdicago sativa (Alfalfa, Luzerne). This forage plant is so famil­iar to all Nevadans as to scarcely require mention. But it did so poorly'on the field, and on the same soil with the oth(jr grasses, tha.t a comparison will be interesting. A plot was thickly seeded with . this on the 1st of 1fay, 1889. The growth was uniform, but only sixteen inches tall. This year a part of the plot received water rather sparingly, and on the 11th of June it was eight to ten inches tall. Two-thirds of the plot received no water and was killed. Several other grasses and clovers thrived better under the same treahnent. It is one of the most nutritious of forage crops, stock fattening on it alone. Analysis shows it to contain when in bloom: water, 15 per cent.; ash, six and one-half to seven and 'one-half per cent. ; albunlinoids, thirteen to. fourteen per cent.; crude fibre, twenty-se\~en to twenty-nine per cent.; nitrogen, free extract, thirty­two to thirty-five per cent.; fat, two and a quarter to three per cent. Onobrychis saUva (Espercette, Sanfoin). rrhis forage plant has recently been attracting some attention in the West. It is a perennial growing from one to three feet high, bearing pinnate leaves and rosy pink flowers. It has but sparse foliage and blooms about the luiddle of ~lay. In smne places where it has been tried the seed has failed to germinate and the fault has been attributed to poor seed. Our experience at this Station leads to the conclusion that the failure to gernlinate has been due to insufficient moisture. We sowed four plots with this species. The soil was thoroughly soaked with water after the seeding was done. One received no more water during the season. Another received the SaIne quantity of water as the other clover plots. The third had a little more applied, and the fourth was kept quite wet most of the time. The plot receiving no water last year had none this year, but the large precipitation of last winter soaked the ground so thoroughly· that this spring six or seven small plants appeared and made a feeble growth. The plot receiving water like the grass plots had a few plants on it but they made only a feeble growth. The next plot had nlore plants come up and the growth was better. But few more plants canle up on the two plots last named. The fourth plot had a pretty fair growth last season, though the plants were too scattered in the ground, and this year the crop grew and was harvested without the application of a drop of water. FrOln this short experiment it appears that it requires an abundance of water to get a good stand, but the second season a fair crop of hay may be removed in May without water. The first blossoms appeared this. year April 25th. 16 Ornithopus sativu8 (Seradella). This is a low growing perennial or biennial of a light grayish green color. The leaves are about as large as those of Seradella, but spread out near the surface of the ground. The blossoms are smaller and fewer in a cluster than those of Seradella, but are nearly of the same color. 'rhe growth is too small and close to the ground to be of value as a hay ~rop but it may be found valuable for pasturage. A plot was sown June 10, 1889, on the Station grounds, and on August 28th it was in bloom, the flower stalks being twenty-four inches tall and the leaves five. inches long. This year it is spreading pretty well, was eight to eleven inches high and in full bloom June 10th. It is said to withstand drought well and it made a fair growth before water was applied this year. These plots were all upon a stiff clay soil, without manure. It is not of the character of soil. found in the valleys and farming dis­tricts of the State. It is a valuable experiment, however, to him who wishes to study these grasses and forage plants under adverse conditions of soil and water. MELONS. 'rhe soil where the experiments in the growing of vegetables was made was less adapted to the cultivation of melons than of any other Icrops grown. Th~ planting was done June 11th, and they were gathered as:they rIpened. MUSK MELON. The musk melon did better than the other melons on this soil. The first to ripen was Sibley's Best, which ripened two melons ninety-five days from planting. Arlington was the next to ripen. The most productive was Champions' Market, and the' largest was Montreal. The seed of nearly all the varieties appeared to be mixed, and there were at least two distict types of melon in nearly every plot. Of some varieties this may be the· ordinary state. Sibley's Best. - The flesh of this variety is greenish yellow, tender and juicy, moderately sweet. The average product was one melon to each vine. Arlington (Department of Agriculture).-In shape this fruit is an oblate spheroid, skin green, becoming blotched with yellow when very ripe. Flesh green, or granular yellow, juicy and has a fine rich flavor. Golden Perfection.-This is a late variety. Flesh orange, firm, rather waxy, sweet but poor flavor. Vandalia.-A late variety and of lnedium quality. It is not a productive variety. Montreal.-One of the best of the new varieties. Round, deeply 17 ribbed, much flattened at the ends, skin green and profusely netted. This variety often attains very great size. Champion Market.-This is a little later than the preceding and quite different in form, being oblong or oval and lightly ribbed, but the ribs are very prominent on account of their bright yellow color contrasting with the dark green of other parts of the melon. The flesh is green granular, very sweet and of a very fine flavor. This is one of the most prolific varieties grown. Fruit picked about the middle of September. Champion Market.-Description and quality about the same as the preceding. , WATERMELONS. Kentucky Wonder.-But three vines grew and one melon"of poor quality matured.' III Baltimore.-Skin striped light and dark green. Flesh light green with numerous hard white spots. Poor in quality. Volga.-Almost a perfect globe in shape. Flesh red, firm and crisp. Seeds small gray-brown with flesh close about them. Rind very thin and hard. Flavor excellent. This is a distinct Russian' variety and a splendid keeper. This variety is the most uniform of the lot and altogether the most desirable. I{olb's Gem.-A comparatively new variety. Rind rather thick and tough. Of medium quality. Hungarian Honey.-Said to be from Hungary and described as a dark green, round, thin rind variety. There were but two ripened. The skin was striped green· with narrower bands of light green. Flesh light rosy red and granular. Fairly firm and sweet. Phinney's Early. -Oblong. Skin dark and light green. Flesh bright red but full of hard green spots. Average weight 6.3 pounds. POTATOES-REPORT FOR 1889. But eight varieties of potatoes were sent for trial last year, and they were received too late. to make a fair trial as to yield. As they were all planted on the same date, the comparison between the different varieties is interesting. The soil was a stiff clay slightly more loamy than that upon which the other varieties of crops were sown. The varieties were all planted July 3, 1889, and harvested, counted and weighed October 28th. Following are descriptive notes and remarks on the yields: Early Mayflower (Brownell).-Tubers oval, flattish, white skin with. a slight russety surface. Eyes few and shallow. There were three tubers, weighing 101, 90 and 76 grams respectively, which ,were cut into halves and planted in six hills. The yield was 57 large, or merchantable potatoes, and 43 small ones, weighing 10 pounds 14 ounces, and 2 pounds 2 ounces respectively, making a 3-A 18 total of 13 pounds, or 2 pounds 2 ounces per' hill. This was' the largest yield obtained. Winner (Brownell).-Skin of tuber smooth with a slight red or rosy tint, slightly flattened. Eyes few and shallow. Four tubers weighing 190, 160, 151 and 63 grams respectively were planted, the smallest one halved and the others quartered, making fourteen hills. There were harvested 78 large and 66 small potatoes, the total weights being 22 pounds 12 ounces, and 3 pounds 4 ounces respect­ively, making a total of 26 pounds, or an average of 1.1 ounces per hill. Ross (Murray).-Skin white with very little russet in it. Eyes few and shallow; flesh white and firIll.. When planted there were sprouts one-quarter of an inch long. Seven tubers weighing 78, 77, 75, 67, 64 and 63 grams respectively, were halved and planted in hills. The product consisted of 70 merchantable and 147 small potatoes, weighing 14 pounds 7 ounces, and 7 pounds 1 ounce each, or a total of 21 pounds 8 ounces. The average yield per hill was 1 pound 8 ounces. Summit (Stine).-Skin nearly white with a slight blush. Tubers long, sometimes tapering, slightly flattened. Eyes few and superficial. Tubers were fresh and crisp and just beginning to sprout. Six tubers weighing 275, 189, 173, 159, 128 and 127 grams respectively were quartered and planted in twenty-four hills. The yield consisted of 120 large and 135 small potatoes, weighing 36 pounds 12 ounces, and 5 pounds 14 ounces respectively, making a total of 42.5 pounds, or 1 pound 12.5 ounces 'per hill. There was great variation in the yield per hill, the largest being four pounds and the smallest but thirteen ounces. Fearnaught (Stine). Skin nearly white, purplish at- eyes and end. Tubers long, slightly tapering and somewhat flattened. Eyes large, even with surface. Flesh white and firm. Five tubers weighing 261, 225, 214, 158 grams respectively, were quartered and planted in twenty hills. The product consisted of 166 large tubers weighing 27 pounds and 13 ounces, and 65 small tubers weighing 4 pounds and 11 ounces, making a total of 32.5 pounds, and an average' of 1 pound 10 ounces per hill. , Early Sunrise (Stine).-Skin smooth white, slighty russety, and rosy about eyes. Flesh white. Tubers long and somewhat .tapering. Eyes nearly even with the surface. Four tubers were received weighing respectively 197" 187, 167 and 130 grams, These were quartered and 16 hills planted. The product was 78 large tubers weighing 18 pounds 6 ounces, and 131 small ones weigh­ing 2 pounds 3 ounces. Total yield 24.5 pounds, or an average of 1 pound 8 ounces per hill. Governor Foraker (Stine).-Skin smooth white and very little russet Tubers long and nearly cylindrical, but tapering a little. Received five tubers weighing 166, 165, 155, 125, 122 grams 19 respectively. These were quartered and twenty' hills planted r~s~1ting in a total yield of 37 pounds 8 ounces of potatoes, con: slstlng of 134 large and 105 small tubers, weighing 35 pounds 12 ounces respectively. The average yield was 1 pound 12 ounces per hill. This was the second largest yield, and the largest per cent. of merchantable potatoes. ~1:rs. Foraker (Stine).-Skin white, russety, flesh white. Tubers nearly round. Eyes very few and even with the surface. The yield consisted of 41 large potatoes weighing 8 pounds 14 ounces, and 3B small ones weighing 2 pounds 2 ounces. The total product was 11 pounds. SWEET CORN. The soil for the sweet corn was a stiff clay, with a good many small rocks in it. The plowing was done May 18th and the ground was harrowed and smoothed with a drag. The planting was done June 6th, 5 to 7 grains to the hill, which were three feet apart and the rows three and one-half feet apart. Nine days from planting all the plots had some stalks up. The stalks were thinned to three in each hill. The first plot to flower was Boynton's Early, which began shedding pollen July 27th, fifty-one days from planting. On the ~8th Early ~iinnesota and Chicago Market began blooming. The last named variety had thefirst edible ears on the 19th of August, just seventy­four days from planting. Three days later Early Minnesota and Boynton's Early were edible. The latest variety was Early Old Colony~ which did not reach sufficient maturity for table until ninety­eight days from planting, three weeks later than the first. BEANS. The beans, like all crops grown in 1889, were grown on a stiff clay soil at the University building. The piece upon which the beans 'were grown was plowed May 17th, and thoroughly harrowed. The seeds were planted about two inches apart in drills two feet apart. They were planted June 5th and irrigated at once. Most of the snap, or string beans, were picked as rapidly as they reached the best con­dition for the ttLble. The pickings were .continued until August 12th for a part. The stalks were then left until cut by the frost, and such pods as were then dry were gathered for seed.' . Black-eyed Wax (Ferry). This was obtained by crossing the Golden Wax and the Black Wax and was introduced by Henderson three years ago. The pods are medium to large, flat, yellow, fleshy, tender, with but little string. It was up ten days from plant- . ing, in bloom in forty-four days, and first picking of edible pods was fifty-eight days after planting. It was killed by frost October 9th, 20 the plants being well filled with dry and withered pods. The pods averaged 3.6 inches in length. The yield was good. 'Vhite vVax (Ferry). This variety has waxy white pods of med­ium size, averaging 3.1 inches in length. The first plants began to appear above ground ten days from planting and the first picking of edible pods was sixty-two days after planting. Only four pickings of snap beans was made of this yariety. The average yield for these four pickings was 9.2 ounces to ten feet of row. Black Wax (Ferry). This is a medium size~podded variety with thick, fleshy, ahnost white pods which were tender and ahn6st with­out string. The plants canle up !1icely within ten days from plant­ing. The first edible pods were gathered fifty-eight days after planting and the pickings were made the last of August. . When I • killed by frost October 9th the plants were still loaded with fine string beans. 'fhe yield was thirty ounces to each ten feet of row. The number of pods per plant 8.5. Black Wax (Northrup B. and G. Co.). Although of the same name as the precedint this differs from it in many respects. The pods are very large and of a waxy white color. .They came up nicely within ten days from planting; but it was over sixty-eight days fronl planting to the first picking. When killed by the frost the pods were all dry, differing from the preceding in this respect. The average nUlnber of pods to each plant was 6.9 ; average length, 4.4 inches. . Golden Wax (Cox). Plants compact and bushy. Pods of luedium size, yellow, fleshy, brittle, tender and without string. Came up uniforlnly within ten days. In bloom in forty-four days and first picking of edible pods in fifty-eight days. Six pickings were HULde; the last on the 24th of August. When killed by the frost there were many string beans and ripe ones on the stalks. Golden Wax (Ferry). Like the preceding this was prolific, and the pods were a little smaller. Average yield per ten feet of row, 70.3 ounces. Dwarf Golden Wax (Bowen). This plot germinated very poorly, the plants averaging over a foot apart. The stalks were very shott and bushy, the blossoms white and pods greenish white, round, fleshy, tender, snap, but with little string. The plants came up in fourteen days and first bloom in thirty-seven days. Six pickings were made. Average .yield to ten feet of row, 16.6 ounces. This variety is of No. 1 table quality, cooking very easily and is rich and of good flavor. . Dwarf German Wax (Bowen). This appears to be identical with the Black Wax. The yield was 14. 5 ounces to each ten feet, there being three \plants to the foot. Detroit Wax (Ferry). Seems to be the same as black wax, but more prolific. The seed was rather slow to germinate. Yield 35.4 21 ounces to each ten feet of row. The fruit picking was sixty-eight days from planting. The pods averaged 3.5 inches long. . Flageolet Violet -Wax (Ferry). The plants are short, stalky, branching well. Pods yellow, fleshy, tender. String beans were gathered four times. Yield 27.6 ounces string beans to ten feet of row. Flageolet Scarlet Wax (Ferry). Des<!ription same as preceding, and the first edible beans were gathered August 2d. This is some­what more prolific than the preceding There were three plants per foot bearing thirteen pods per plant, giving an average yield of 48.2 ounces to ten feet. When cooked the flavor is but medium. The other varieties tried are shown in the following tables, Nos. 10 to 15 inclusive. BEANS. Numberof Average Average Number I Variety. I Seedsman.

Of the ExperiInent Station on the result of the experiments in 1890, with the exception of the report on the potato crop, which has been given. The corn is reported as a failure. All the beans showed good results 'and the peas were good. The beet crop was a failure. The watermelons were good and so were the muskmelons. The pump­kins and onion crops are reported as failures. rrhe radish did well, but the parsnip and lettuce crops were failures. Of the grasses the following varieties gave good results and are highly recOlnmended: Blue Grass, vVhite Clover, Orchard Grass, Red and White Clover, Alsike Clover, Red Top, Meadow Fescue, Creeping Bent and Velvet GrM~ ~ 31 REPORT Of the Entomologist and Botanist.-Fred H. Hillman, Entomologist and Botanist. The Department of Entomology and Botany was organized in June, 1889, when the work of entOlnological investigation was added to the work in botany. On taking charge of the work Qf the departnlent July 23, 1889, I found the entire equiplnent consisted of a slnall quantity of insect pins, .corks and printed labels; a good supply of botanical and mounting paper, some printed botanical labels and fifty or more botanical specimens, partly Inounted and partly in press. In the Station library were a half dozen or more works relating to the subject of entomology and botany. The work of further equipment was begun iInlnediately and continued from time to thne till the department is now fairly well supplied with apparatus ,sufficient to carryon practical work. Other apparatus will be needed, however, as the demands of the department in­crease. Among the additions made in equipment thus far are: A large herbariuln case, a supply of apparatus necessary in collecting and pressing plants, two first-class cases of thirty eighteen by fifteen inch drawers, each to contain the collections of insects, a case for drying insects and a breeding cage containing eighteen separate compartnlents. For experhnental work in entomology, the depart­ment is supplied with a Nixon No. 2 force pump and full set of nozzles, a Climax spray pump presented to the Experiment Station by the nlanufacturer, R. S. Chaplnan, San Francisco, and a Lewis force punlp, also presented by the maker, P. C. Lewis, Katskill, New York. . ' The work of the present year has been confined in the main to the following:, , First.-Investigation of injurious insects. Second.-Experiments with various insecticides to determine their effectiveness in the destruction of the more injurious insects of the present year. ' Third.-The formation and study of a collection of representative insects. Fourth.-The formation of a representative herbarium. Fifth.-A somewhat extended study of the plants peculiar to Western' Nevada. Sixth.-Experiments with numerous grasses grown under irriga­tion. But few injurious insects have seemed to demand especial attention thus far. Of these, may be mentioned the Codling moth, carpacapsa pomonella, a rose-bud borer, Lithophane antennata, a certain species 32 of plant lice infesting the apple, and a saw fly larvre, Selandria cerasi, destroying the leaves of the pear and cherry. In the investigation of the Codling moth injury, a circular was sent· to the apple growers throughout the State after -the harvest of the apple crop of 1889. _ The answers to inquiries made in the cir­cular showed that many localities of the State were free from the moth, and that in others from fifty per cent. to seventy-five per cent. of the fruit was injured. Reports of greatest injury came from the counties of OrInsby, Washoe, Elko and Douglas. Over thirty per cent. of the apple crop in these counties was reported injured. Observations about Reno and Carson showed that while some orchards were almost free from the attack others were so badly affected that little fruit remained uninjured.- During the latter part of May and early June a lepidopterous larvre played much havoc about Reno by boring into the buds and destroying the flowers. The distributioil and habits of the insect were investigated preparatory to the application of renledies for its ravages. Early in the year the pear and cherry slug, Selandria cerasi, was noticed to be destroying a great part of the leaves of the pear and cherry. While the attack seemed to be very general, it was found to be much more marked in some places than in others. During the present season a study of the plant lice affecting the apple has been carried on, hoping to extend our -knowledge regarding these pests. This has resulted in the discovery, for this vicinity at least, of a disease which is apparently destroying a greater number of the plant leaf lice than are all their other natural enemies cOlllbined. NUlllerous other insect pests have been noticed but no cOInplaint regarding thmn has been made as yet. INSECTICIDES. Of the experiments with insecticides performed, London purple was applied by means of a force pump and fine spray to the young fruit in three different apple orchards in Carson and one in Reno, in the endeavor to prevent the attacks of the Codling moth. The nlixture used was of the strength of one pound of poison to 250 gallons of water~a mixture sufficiently strong to kill any larvre finding it in their food, and yet not so strong as to injure the foliage. This mixture was applied on two occasions to the trees in Carson, the first at the time the blossoms were falling, and the second about fourteen days later. Reports from Carson later in the season show that while a part of the fruit seemed to be saved, the benefit was not so marked as on previous occasions. I feel con­fident that the injury was due to the second brood of moths, which appeared sometime after the second spraying. Results from the orchard treated in Reno were not received by the department. With a hope of finding a destroyer for the rose-bud borer, the 33 poison London purple, Paris green and white hellebore were thor­oughly tried. This proved, however, that as ordinarily applied these poisons are useless in destroying Lithophane antennata. In the application of remedies for the destruction of the pear and cherry slug, tobacco decoction, white hellebore and pyrethrum, or buhach were used with success. This work will be found treated more fully in bulletin No. 10. I Kerosene emulsion, tobacco decoc­tion and carbolic soap were successfully used to destroy the plant lice of the apple. Bulletin No. 11 gives the preparation of these insecti­cides. The Department is greatly indebted to the numerous fruit growers about Carson and Reno, who have kindly granted the use of their orchards for the trials of experiments. PLANTS. Much attention has been given to the important work of forming a representative collection of insects. The collection now contains between 5,000 and 6,000 mounted specimens, and a biological division containing a large number of additional specimens pre­served in alcohol. This last is deemed an important and valuable feature, for the collection of mature insects is enriched by having represented the various forms of the different stages of affected plants and fruits, all of which is invaluable to the worker in economic entomology. It is planned to exchange a part of the duplicates for representa­tive injurious and beneficial insects; the addition of which will add greatly to the economic value of the collection. . The formation of a herbarium is well under way. It now con­tains nearly 2,000 specimens representing local species. The acqui- , sition of many valuable species by exchange is planned. In order to gain a more practical knowledge of the florre of the State, considerable time ha~ been spent in the study of many of the plants taken during the yea". GRASSES. The seed of thirty-seven species of grasses was sown in the spring in plots. Some of these, however, were far too small, owing to the ·limited amount of seed. The plots in question have been under irrigation. The object is to obtain ultimately, if possible, Smue valuable additions to our at present limited list of forage plants. The ground upon which the seed was sown was placed in good con­dition, being deeply and finely worked, having all the small rocks cleared away, etc. After being delayed over a month by the absence of water for irrigation, the seed was finally· sown on the 14th and 15th of May. Irrigation was commenced immediately and con­tinued during the season. The result of the same treatment upon 5-A F. H. HILLMAN. 34 the different species has been various, many of them scarcely any­thing at all. Only the following species can be spoken of as having made a fair growth: Agrostic stolonifera (Creeping Bent Grass).-Came up well and made a fairly good growth. . Medicago sativa (Alfalfa). Made an excellent growth~ . Lolium pratensis (English Rye Grass). Made a scatterIng growth. Lolium italicum (Italian Rye Grass). Gained a good start and later formed a dense mat. ' Trifolium hybridum (Alsike). Made a fine growth, covering the ground with a dense mat. . . Glores barbata. Made a fair growth in tufts. Plot small, only a few feet square. Agrostic Abysinica. Made a heavy growth on a small plot. Bulletins Nos. 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Experiment Station have been issued from this department. Bulletin No.8 treats of the Codling moth, Carpocapsa pomonella. The bulletin discusses the in­sect's history, life history, remedies under which head the absence of dangers in the use of arsenical compounds is discussed, and the progress of the insect in Nevada. In the appendix the various force pumps and nozzles in common use are illustrated and briefly treated. Bulletin No.9 relates to the rose-bud borer, Lithophane antennata. In this the nature of the injury is explained, the insect's identifying characters mentioned, its life history related and a discussion of remedies given. In bulletin No. 10 the pear and cherry slug, Selandria cerasi, is discussed. The insect is practically described and its life history is given. Remedies, their formation and application close the dis­cussion. Bulletin No. 11, Plant Lice Infesting· the Apple, enumerates the different species of these pests. It treats of the plant lice in general, and those infesting the apple in particul~r. The natural enemies of the lice are referred to and illustrations (of them given. Lastly, the reader's attention is called to the practical remedies. A few interested persons throughout the State have corresponded with the department relative to injurious or beneficial insects and plants. All inquiries have been promptly answered, giving all the information possible. While activity in correspondence has' not been nearly so marked as it should be, yet I am satisfied that the work of the department is receiving more and more attention and is growing in popularity. Respectfully, 35 REPORT Of the Departrnent of Chemistry.-J. Warne Phillips, Chemist. During the past year the apparatus of the laboratory has been increased by new supplies, increasing both the scope and capability of work. 'Vithout enumerating the new pieces thus added, suffice it to say its equiplnent is all that is necessary for the performance of the ordinary analyses involved in agricultural chemistry. More attention has been paid to the analysis and study of soil than any other subject. Soil analysis is very importa~t, especially in a country whose agricultural interests are just developing, in determining those soils which contain all the mineral elements of plant food and in quanti­ties sufficient for the profitable production of crops. Liebig has clearly shown that vegetation can exist only where the soil contains the ash ingredients of the plants. A soil to contain the ash ingredients of plants, or what are called the mineral elements of plant food, which are necessary for plant growth-and are obtained from the soil alone----Inust contain the following substances: phos­phoric acid, potash, soda, silica, lime, magnesiuln, iron, oxides, sul­phuric acid, and hydrochloric acid. The soils thus far analyzed were not found wanting in the above Inineral elements, but some contained an excessive amount of alkali carbonates, carbonate of lime and magnesia, to their detriment; and others to such an extent to be worthless, as is .shown- in No. 15. It is possible to neutralize the alkali in SOlne degree but to what extent is yet to be determined. The importance of soil analysis, thus aiding in reclaiming arid land, especially where the alkali carbonate soils abound, is clearly seen. Besides the following samples of soil, whose analyses are given below, a number of others were partially. analyzed, determining only the most important constituents. In separating the soil into the different grades of fineness, the fine material represents all particles less than a twentieth of an inch in diameter. Fine gravel particles between a tenth and one­twentieth of an inch in diameter; coarse gravel particles between one-tenth and one-fifth of an inch in diameter; stone:s, all particles greater than one-fifth of an inch in diameter. I have secured a large number of minerals, ores, etc., for identi­fication and analysis qualitatively, a number of which were anal­yzed quantitatively also. Antimony ore secured frOln Mr. E. T. George, containing anti­mony, lead, iron and ,sulphur. Antimony 38.84 per cent. Sediment of mineral spring near Carson contained water, silica, organic matter, traces of chlorine, magnesia, soda, lime, sulphuric acid and boric acid. Sodium biborate (borax), 76.29 per cent. Analysis of slate or coal furnished by Mr. E. T. George: ash, 36 94.01 ; carbon, .10; water, .61; volatile matter, 5.28. The volatile matter was principally carbon dioxide. Mineral water analysis, sample from Walley's Hot Springs near Genoa, in grains per U.

HINCKLEY A man of vision and foresight, a 20th century pioneer, a philanthropist, an entrepreneur, and an untiring builder of education and of the American political system--all are apt descriptions of Robert H. Hinckley, a Utah native and tireless public servant. Robert H. Hinckley began his political career as a state legislator from Sanpete County and a mayor of Mount Pleasant. Hinckley then rose to serve as the Utah director for the New Deal program under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Hinckley went on to serve in various capacities in Washington, D.C., from 1938 to 1946 and again in 1948. During those years he established and directed the Civilian Pilot Training Program, served as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Air, and directed the Office of Contract Settlement after WWII. In these positions Hinckley proved himself to be, as one of his colleagues stated, "One of the real heroes of the Second World War." Also in 1946, Hinckley and Edward Noble jointly founded the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and over the next two decades helped to build this company into the major television network it is today. Spurred by the adverse political climate of the `40s, `50s, and `60s, Hinckley recognized the need to demonstrate that politics was "honorable, decent and necessary," and to encourage young people to get involved in the political process. After viewing programs at Harvard, Rutgers and the University of Mississippi, Hinckley believed the time was right for an institute of politics at the University of Utah. So in 1965, through a major contribution of his own and a generous bequest from the Noble Foundation, Robert H. Hinckley established the Hinckley Institute of Politics to promote respect for practical politics and to teach the principle of citizen involvement in government. "Every student a politician" was Hinckley's dream. The Hinckley Institute of Politics strives to fulfill that dream by sponsoring internships, scholarships, forums, mentoring and a minor in Campaign Management. Today, 42 years later, Hinckley's dream is a reality. More than 4,000 students have participated in programs he made possible through the Hinckley Institute of Politics. Many of these students have gone on to serve as legislators, members of Congress, government staffers, local officials, and judges. All participants have, in some measure, become informed, active citizens. Reflecting on all of his accomplishments, Robert H. Hinckley said, "The Hinckley Institute is one of the most important things I will have ever done." 4 ABOUT THE HINCKLEY INSTITUTE OF POLITICS HINCKLEY INSTITUTE OF POLITICS UNIVERSITY OF UTAH The Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah is a bipartisan institute dedicated to engaging students in governmental, civic, and political processes; promoting a better understanding and appreciation of politics; and training ethical and visionary students for service in the American political system. Robert H. Hinckley founded the Hinckley Institute of Politics in 1965 with the vision to, "teach students respect for practical politics and the principle of citizen involvement in government." Since it's founding, the Hinckley Institute has provided a wide range of programs for students, public school teachers and the general public including: internships, courses, forums, scholarships and mentoring. The Hinckley Institute places emphasis on providing opportunities for practical experience in politics. INTERNSHIP PROGRAM A nationally recognized program and the heart of the Hinckley Institute, the Hinckley internship program provides internship scholarships and places over 200 students every year in political and government offices, non-profit organizations, campaigns, and think tanks. The Institute provides internship opportunities to students from all majors for academic credit in Washington, D.C., at the Utah State Legislature, in local offices and campaigns, and internationally. CAMPAIGN MANAGEMENT MINOR The Hinckley Institute of Politics offers an undergraduate minor in Campaign Management designed to provide undergraduate students the opportunity to learn the theory and practices that will allow them to be effective participants in election and advocacy campaigns. Students are required to complete a political internship and an interdisciplinary series of courses in areas such as campaign management; interest groups and lobbying; voting, elections and public opinion; media; and other practical politics. PUBLIC FORUMS AND EVENTS The Hinckley Institute hosts weekly Hinckley Forums where political speakers address public audiences in the Hinckley Caucus Room. Hinckley Forums enable students, faculty, and community members to discuss a broad range of political concepts with local, national, and international politicians, ambassadors, activists, and academics. The Institute also co-hosts national conferences on campaign finance. Past guests include Presidents Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford; Senators Orrin Hatch, John McCain, and Harry Reid; Utah Governor Michael Leavitt; and many other notable politicians and professionals. The speeches are broadcast on KUER 90.1 FM radio and KUED TV. SCHOLARSHIPS AND LOANS The Hinckley Institute provides substantial financial aid to students through the Robert H. Hinckley, Abrelia Clarissa Hinckley, Anne and John Hinckley, Senator Pete Suazo, and Scott M. Matheson scholarship funds. The Hinckley Institute is also the University of Utah representative for the Harry S. Truman Congressional Scholarship and the James Madison Fellowship--two of America's most prestigious scholarships. HUNTSMAN SEMINAR FOR TEACHERS The Huntsman Seminar in Constitutional Government for Teachers is a week long seminar sponsored by the Huntsman Corporation. The primary focus of the seminar is to improve the quality of civic education in Utah schools by bringing Utah educators together with political experts and visiting politicians to discuss current events in Utah and American politics. The Huntsman Seminar is truly a unique opportunity for teachers to gain an in-depth understanding of local and national political issues. The Hinckley Institute of Politics is located in 253 OSH For Further Information call (801) 581-8501 DEPARTMENT OF POLITICAL SCIENCE The Department of Political Science values its relationship with the Hinckley Institute for the opportunities the Institute provides students to enrich their academic studies with experience in practical politics. The Institute's programs complement the academic offerings of the Political Science Department. Courses are available in five subfields of the discipline: American Politics, International Relations, Comparative Politics, Political Theory, and Public Administration. For undergraduate students, the Department offers a major with B.A. and B.S. degrees and a teaching minor. Undergraduate certificate programs in International Relations, Public Administration, and Practical Politics are open to both majors and non-majors. At the graduate level, the Department offers M.A. and M.S. degrees, including the Master of Public Administration, Master of Public Policy, and the Ph.D. degree. Dual degrees are available at the graduate level with Educational Administration, Law, Social Work, and Health Services Administration. The Department has several undergraduate scholarships, both need-based and merit-based available to entering freshmen and continuing students.

SNOW (1937-2006) The Hinckley Institute joins thousands of former colleagues, students and interns in mourning the loss of Dr. R.J. Snow, the second director of the Hinckley Institute of Politics, serving from 1975 to 1985. R.J. was an extraordinary scholar and administrator and a mentor, friend and example to many. While his loss is painful and we will miss him dearly, he leaves a lasting legacy of love for our country and unmatched devotion to students and higher education. THE LEGACY OF R.J. SNOW "The people who leave the most lasting legacies are often those who don't worry about such things while they're alive. Such seems to be the case with R.J. Snow, the former University of Utah and Brigham Young University vice president who died on Tuesday in an automobile accident near his home. Snow, 68, was just preparing to teach his final political science course this summer before retiring. At a time when nerves in the state and nation are strained and tensions are often pulled taut, the loss of R.J. Snow is like the loss of a great athlete during crunch time. He was taken at a crucial moment. He was at the top of his game. Still, given all that, one hopes the life he lived will now resonate even stronger; that those who are left to grapple with the problems of politics, education and society will find his memory and meaningful example--his legacy--calling forth in themselves R.J. Snow's hallmark decency and civility." Deseret Morning News, June 9, 2006. HINCKLEY INSTITUTE DIRECTORS REMEMBER THEIR COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND Hinckley Institute Director Kirk L. Jowers: "R.J. was a great mentor, friend, and example. The love he showed for the students and for our country has been his lasting legacy at the Hinckley Institute. I join thousands of former students and interns in mourning his passing." Hinckley Institute Director Ted Wilson: "He had a wonderful way about him. He would try to put salve on the wounds and balm on the situations to make the world better. He was very low key but very smart. He just really loved people." Hinckley Institute founding Director J.D. Williams: "I so admired him as a student, treasured him as a colleague, and stood in awe of his qualities as a husband to Marilyn and father to four magnificent children. If one wants to know why teaching has been a great career, it's because I knew R.J. Snow." 6 HINCKLEY JOURNAL OF POLITICS 2007 Warming up to Credit Freeze Laws: The Case of Utah W. Brett Barrus The high-profile personal information data breaches of 2005 drew considerable public attention to the growing crime of identity theft. In order to equip consumers with tools for ID theft prevention, several states enacted credit freeze laws. Originating in California in 2001, these types of laws allow consumers to have more control over who can access their credit reports by placing a "freeze" on their records. There has been substantial debate regarding the merits of credit freezes. The credit reporting industry sees this process as unnecessary and "overkill," touting their own fraud alerts services as sufficient to protect consumers. Consumer advocates, however, view these laws as one of the strongest protections consumers can have against abuse of their personal credit information. This study advances understanding of credit freeze laws by exploring the main arguments for and against them and detailing the history of Utah's unique credit freeze law. This study identifies the key factors that aided the law's passage in 2006 despite having failed in 2005. This is accomplished through interviews of individuals directly involved with the passage of the law in 2006 and relevant literature in periodicals and government reports. The discussion of Utah's law emphasizes the differences between it and credit freeze laws passed in other states as well as proposed national legislation. Finally, this study speculates on the future of credit freeze laws in Utah and nationally. The passage of Utah's law with its unique 15-minute freeze feature has created an intriguing situation for other states and the credit industry. It has in essence drawn a line in the sand--for other states, the credit bureaus, and the federal government--to cross over or retreat from in determining national policy regarding the future of credit freeze laws. INTRODUCTION I n the 2006 Utah legislative session, lawmakers concluded a two-year struggle to determine whether a "credit freeze" would become a viable identity theft prevention option for Utah's consumers. The goal of this legislation was to limit third-party access to a consumer's credit information to only consumer-designated vendors. In doing so, the law would potentially prevent criminals from committing the most common type of identity theft ? the opening of fraudulent credit accounts and loans. This type of legislation has become increasingly common in the wake of high-profile data breaches in such private and public organizations as ChoicePoint, the Department of Veteran's Affairs, and DSW shoe warehouse. Utah's law also contained a 15-minute, credit "thaw" feature that established this law as particularly unique. Making this "thaw" part of the bill was instrumental in gaining enough support to pass the legislation. Utah's law is being heralded as a template for other states but now all state cred- it freeze laws are being threatened by national legislation that could preempt these state laws. In this paper, I will explain what credit freeze laws are and the main arguments for and against them. I will then relate the history of Utah's credit freeze law focusing on the key factors that aided its passage in 2006 despite having failed in 2005. In the course of this discussion, I will emphasize the differences between Utah's law and credit freeze laws passed in other states and proposed national legislation. Finally, I will forecast the probable future of credit freeze laws in Utah and nationally. The type of legislation that I will be discussing has been alternately called a credit freeze and a security freeze in the media, research and in the legislation. For consistency I will use the term "credit freeze" throughout the paper except where the term "security freeze" is used in a direct quotation. IDENTITY THEFT Consumers place a freeze on their reports, thereby limiting access to the report by creditors. Credit bureaus are required to unfreeze the report at the request of the consumer. After providing some type of security code, the report is unfrozen or thawed for a specific period of time or for a specific creditor. The thawing and freezing typically is done at a reasonable cost to the consumer. In essence, any potential criminal armed with an individual's information would not be able to create a fraudulent account because the reports would be frozen and the criminal would not have the access code to thaw them. CREDIT FREEZE LEGISLATION IN RESPONSE TO NATIONAL DATA BREACHES In the wake of the large ChoicePoint and LexisNexis data breaches of 2005, a frenzy of lawmaking within the individual U.S. states produced various credit or credit freeze laws. In fact, many bills addressing identity theft had been or were in the process of becoming laws at the time of these breaches. Identity theft laws are not entirely new. Federal laws making identity theft illegal have been in effect since the 1998 passage of the Identity theft and Assumption Deterrence Act. But the sheer scale of the breaches caused something of a panic and the public outcry turned these incidents into catalysts for stronger and more prolific legislation. These incidents raised awareness of the issue and revealed the large hole in policy related to identity theft. Most prominently, issues concerning the notification requirements surrounding such breaches and possible future preventative measures became the focus of debate. In the years after the initial incidents, many states, including Utah, passed their own notification requirements and credit freeze laws as preventative measures. Prior to the data breaches of 2005, only California and Texas had freeze laws in effect, though several other states had laws under consideration (see Fig 1.1). The first credit freeze law was passed in California in 2001 in combination with another law specifying the terms in which businesses were to disclose breaches and losses of personal information (U.S. PIRG). The law served as a model for laws to come and was the standard by which consumer notification of the LexisNexis and ChoicePoint breaches occurred. Within a year of these high-profile breaches, 23 states had passed laws 8 HINCKLEY JOURNAL OF POLITICS 2007 mandating the terms of credit freezes and 34 states had laws specifying data breach notifications (U.S. PIRG). Currently, there are 45 states with notification laws and 26 states with credit freeze laws. The speed with which the states passed their legislation as well as the general newness of these types of laws, has led to significant differences between the various states' laws. While the general operation of these laws is similar, there are several variable parts of each law. States have all made different decisions regarding the coverage, cost, and the duration of freezes and thaws. The differences in these state laws have a large effect on the preventative ability of a particular law and subsequently, the level and sources of political support. This lawmaking resulted in 26 states which currently have credit freeze laws, some of which are substantially different from one another. This so-called "patchwork" of laws has led the credit reporting agencies, who generally oppose credit freeze legislation, and some national lawmakers to push for a national law preempting the states' laws. Later, I will discuss examples of national laws under consideration and what effect they may have on state laws. Currently, there is considerable debate regarding the part that credit freeze laws should play in protecting consumers. The three major credit bureaus that produce the vast majority of credit reports are Experian, Equifax, and Transunion. These corporations have typically favored promoting their own identity theft prevention and account monitoring services over any sort of credit freeze legislation. Whereas credit freeze laws only dictate the actions of the three reporting bureaus which collect and maintain the information in credit reports, the notification laws passed along with many credit freeze laws are aimed at both credit bureaus and creditors who buy information from them. How both of these laws are carried out will potentially have a large effect on the security of consumers' personal information and credit. THE ARGUMENTS REGARDING CREDIT FREEZE LAWS The largest point of variance among the state laws pertains to who is permitted to place a freeze on their credit information. Currently, 5 of the 26 states with credit freeze laws only allow victims of identity theft to place freezes on their accounts. Washington is the only state that allows credit freezes to consumers on the condition that they are potential victims of identity theft. They must have received notification that their personal information may have been compromised due to a data breach before they can freeze their files (see Fig 1.1). Opponents of credit freeze cite that only individuals who have been notified that they could be at risk of identity theft need a credit freeze. J. Craig Sherman, vice President for the National Retail Federation, states: "Our concern is that the credit freeze issue has become overkill, because most consumers are never going to be the victims of ID theft. If consumers place a credit freeze on their files, it can cause difficulties when trying to purchase homes, cars or even opening simple lines of credit at a department store (Hunt Craig Bikmore from the Utah Auto Dealers Association; Jim Olsen, President of the Utah Retail Merchants Association; and Howard Headlee of the Utah Bankers Association. In total, there were eight individuals there to speak in favor of the bill. Outnumbered were the two lobbyists, Candace Daly and Craig Moody, representing the Consumer Data Industry Association. Not surprisingly, with the support of the business groups, the bill received a favorable recommendation by the committee by a vote of five to one and was sent to the Senate floor for further debate. It was approved by the Senate, again unanimously with an amendment requiring a redundant system that would enable the bureaus to unfreeze records within 15 minutes should their original system fail. They also eliminated routine maintenance as an excuse for not unfreezing records within 15 minutes. These amendments were approved and a substitute bill was introduced to the House. After being approved in the Senate, the bill needed only to be approved by the House of Representatives before it became law. This bill was being carefully watched by the reporting agencies and their representative organization, the Consumer Data Industry Association. As part of their political strategy, they waited to combat the law if and when it reached the House of Representatives. According to Candace Daly, there was not a lot of access for them to the Utah Senate and they felt that they had a better chance of stopping or at least lessening the impact of the legislation on their industry in the House. In fact, while the bill was in the House, they were able to get all of the amendments to the bill that they sought (Daly, 2007). During the first committee hearing in the House, representatives from the three reporting agencies as well as a representative from the National Association of Credit Management traveled to Utah to speak against the bill in its first House Committee Hearing. Only Senator Walker was able to attend the hearing, leaving only the opponents of the law to testify. Those who spoke against the bill that day were Craig Moody and Chantele Mack; Murray Johnston, Director of State Government Affairs, Experian; Eric Rosenburg, Transunion; Julie Long, Equifax; Scott W. Lee, General Counsel, NCAM Intermountain. Without any other support Senator Walker deferred her comments to another committee meeting when the proponents of the law could speak for it. On February 17, 2006, the House Business and Labor committee heard testimony again regarding S.B. 71 after it was replaced by the 3rd substitute bill, changing the enact- ment date of the law. Chris Kyler of the Utah Association of Realtors and Craig Bickmore of the Utah Auto Retailers Association spoke in favor of the bill, with Dean Wangsgarn, President of the National Association of Credit Management, and Candace Daly representing the Consumer Data Industry, speaking against it. The committee approved the bill nine to four and sent it to the floor of the House for a vote. On February 27, two days before the legislative general session adjourned, the bill passed the House unanimously and the Senate concurred unanimously with all of the amendments the next day. S.B. 71 was signed into law by the Governor John Huntsman Jr. on March 20, 2006. One of the most debated issues during this session was the enactment date of the bill. The original version of S.B 71 had September 1, 2006 as the enactment date with September 1, 2008 as the date that violations of the law could be enforced by the Attorney General. The 2nd Substitute S.B. 71 amended those dates to make the entire bill inactive until September 2007. The 3rd substitute S.B. 71 had extended that date to September 1, 2008. These substitutions were made by Senator Walker and the attorney general's office at the request of the credit bureaus. The credit bureaus reported that they did not have the systems currently available to meet the criteria of the law and would need at least two years to be able to accommodate consumers who wished to freeze their files and unfreeze them according to Utah's statute. The Senate allowed for the delay in implementation requested by the credit reporting agencies but Senator Walker now regrets that action. "I think we were snookered," said Senator Walker (KUTV News, 2006). By requesting such a large window of time from the passage of the state law until its enactment date, Senator Walker feels that the bureaus were just trying to buy more time to push for national legislation preempting the state's law. In response to Senator Walker's claim, Candace Daly, one of the lobbyists for the Consumer Data Industry Association replied, "That is absolutely not true." She went on to explain that each of the credit bureaus has its own system and cannot share information under collusion and anti-trust laws (Daly, 2007). This means that they will each separately have to develop a system to accommodate for Utah's near instant thaw requirement which will take some time. Deputy Attorney General Kirk Torgensen feels that there may be some legitimacy to the credit bureaus' claim. "We are dictating to them how to run their business," said Torgensen. He acknowledges that the changes necessary to comply with Utah's law could require a large effort. "There are systems that might necessitate development and procedural changes to accommodate the new law's requirements and two years may actually be reasonable (Torgensen, 2007)." Regardless of their motivation for extending the implementation date, the credit reporting agencies been given time to work with the federal government on a consistent national law. 12 HINCKLEY JOURNAL OF POLITICS 2007 PROPOSED NATIONAL LAWS The credit bureaus have been strong supporters of national laws that would create a lone statute and preempt state laws already passed, including Utah's law. In fact, several of the laws proposed in the 2006 session of Congress would have eliminated credit freezes altogether. While none of these bills actually passed, they demonstrated that a national standard is likely to be established soon. A review of the proposed national laws reveals the strength of the credit bureau's influence and paints an uncertain picture for the future of Utah's law. From the inception of new identity theft laws by the states beginning in 2005, there have been arguments for a national, comprehensive law addressing identity security. Norm Magnuson, Vice President of the Consumer Data Industry Association, in January of 2007 stated the following concerning credit freeze laws, "At the start, there was no question we looked at them as problematic. The only thing we're looking for now is consistency (Gelles, 2007)." Think tanks, including the Information Policy Institute also believe that a consistent national standard is the best policy option for both consumers and the credit reporting industry (Information Policy Institute, 2005). In 2006, Kirk Torgensen and all 50 of the state Attorney General's offices wrote letters urging congress to not preempt their own states legislation when it comes to data security. Currently eight states are in the process of adopting the 15 minute unfreeze including California (Torgensen, 2007) (California Progress Report, 2006). Debra Bowen, the California legislator that sponsored the first credit freeze bill, commented, "now that the credit bureaus are being required to give people in other states the ability to lift a freeze in 15 minutes, it only makes sense to give California shoppers that same right (California Progress Report, 2006)." If California and other states were to adopt the same standard as Utah, a great deal more pressure would be put on the federal government to adopt this same standard as part of any federal legislation. This would achieve the consistency that the consumer data industry desires but will most likely not be embraced by the industry as a large part of their data protection policies. Further, if states do not adopt this same standard quickly, federal legislation may reflect the current standard of three days. From the bills considered in 2006, it is difficult to determine conclusively what form federal legislation will take. There were five separate bills focused on identity theft that included sections attempting to regulate credit freezes. These were S. 1408, S. 1780, S. 3568, H.R. 4127 and H.R. 3997 (see Fig. 2 for a comparison of these bills). While none of these bills were passed they do provide an interesting look at how polarized views are on credit freezes and how they should be administered, if at all. Legislation in the Senate including S. 3568 sponsored by Utah's Senator Robert Bennett stalled quickly after being introduced in committee. Meanwhile, the two most prominent bills to be discussed in 2006 were developed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. These were bills H.R. 4127 and H.R. 3997. Both of these bills are drastically different in how they approach the credit freeze issue. H.R. 3997 would have preempted existing state laws and made credit freezes available only to identity theft victims. This bill, among other statues seen as harmful to consumers, sought to establish a national standard for credit freezes. Consumer advocacy groups were angered by its approval by the committee. "It's shocking that at a time when data breaches are in the headlines daily and consumers are at greater risk than ever [of] identity theft, Congress would choose to vote on a bill that would strip consumers of their existing identity-theft protections, " said Susanna Montezemolo, a policy analyst with Consumers Union (Azulay, 2006). The law would also have weakened the requirements imposed on businesses to disclose security breaches. According to Ed. Mierzwinski, Director of U.S. Public Interest Group's consumer program, "This is the worst data bill ever. It is truly a bad bill (Lazarus, 2006)." Lawmakers who voted in favor of the bill were interested in creating a national standard according to chief author, Rep. Steve LaTourette, a republican from Ohio (Lazarus, 2006). This bill enjoyed strong support from the credit reporting agencies that, according the Center for Responsive Politics, spent nearly 30 million dollars in 2005 on lobbying (Azulay, 2006). Soon after H.R. 3997 exited committee, H.R. 4127, which was seen to be much more consumer friendly, passed the committee in a unanimous 41-0 vote (Montezemolo $12 ($36 total) to lift for one creditor per agency $10 to lift temporarily or permanently per credit reporting agency ($30 total); $12 to lift for one creditor per agency ($36 total) $10 to lift temporarily or permanently per credit reporting agency ($30 total); $12 to lift for one creditor per agency ($36 total) California Any Consumer No fee for identity theft victims; $10 for others to freeze at each ($30 total) Colorado 7/1/2006 Any Consumer No fee for first freeze; $10 at each credit reporting agency ($30 total) to place a second freeze $10 to freeze at each credit reporting agency ($30 total) Connecticut 1/1/2006 Any Consumer Delaware 1/1/03 subsequently amended 7/1/2006 Any Consumer No fee to victims of identity theft.

These realities of suburban sprawl may ultimately affect the degree to which this family will choose to be civically engaged in their community. 20 HINCKLEY JOURNAL OF POLITICS 2007 In his book Bowling Alone, Robert Putnam (2000) has identified three distinct reasons which illustrate how suburban sprawl contributes to civic disengagement: "First, sprawl takes time. Second, sprawl is associated with increasing social segregation, and social homogeneity appears to reduce incentives for civic involvement, as well as opportunities for social networks that cut across class and racial lines. Third, most subtly but probably most powerfully, sprawl disrupts community `boundedness'" (p. 214). have indeed increased civic engagement, but it is a shallow representation of the civic engagement born of republican democracy. Unfortunately, the lack of authentic civic engagement occurs because many master-planned communities establish private government associations and are managed by large independent real estate developers rather than being subject to the public municipality wherein the community is established. THE PROBLEMS Out-of-control suburban sprawl and master-planned communities that stifle authentic civic engagement are the two primary problems that are harmful to civic engagement. Three new-urbanism architects, Andres Duany, Elizabeth PlaterZyberk, and Jeff Speck, have identified a nexus that is developing between the lack of civic engagement and suburban sprawl. In their book Suburban Nation they stated: "Critical writing in recent years has documented a decline in the civic life of our nation...dozens of books call attention to the same problem: society seems to be evolving in an unhealthy way. Americans are splintering into insular factions, each pursuing an increasingly narrow agenda, with nary a thought for the greater good. Further, more and more citizens seem to be withdrawing from public life into the shelter of their private homes, from which they encounter the world primarily through their television and computer screens. This is hardly a recipe for productive social evolution" (Duany multiple building contractors that provide diversity in home styles and construction; established commercial centers and shopping districts; and large open space features (e.g. golf courses, lakes, parks, recreational spaces). Master-planned communities work to establish walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods where families can live, shop, work, and play all within walking distance of their homes. Communities that incorporate such design criteria will have greater success in promoting civic engagement. This claim is supported by Putnam (2000) who states "Getting involved in community affairs is more inviting--or abstention less attractive--when the scale of every day life is smaller and more intimate." (P. 205). In short, those who advocate new urbanism--the movement to establish built environments that promote quality of life, conservation of energy, and reduction in consumption and pollution, are becoming widely recognized for their tenacious efforts to combat sprawl and waste, especially as those objectives are accomplished through the development of masterplanned communities. New urbanism architects, urban planners, and developers are to be highly commended because thus far it appears that the implementation of their policies and designs is beginning to bear fruit and America's communities are improving--at least among those who can afford to live in such communities. What is troubling in the zeal to establish master-planned communities is that they can tend to stifle authentic civic engagement. Authentic is used to describe civic engagement in this context because many master-planned communities Putnam (2000) addressed this issue by introducing another component of civic engagement called social capital--the theory that social networks have value. He explained that "social capital refers to connections among individuals--social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them. In that sense, social capital is closely related to what some have called `civic virtue'" (P. 19). According to Putnam, social capital was prevalent throughout the first two-thirds of the twentieth century when it reached a pinnacle in the 1960s. However, the trend did not continue and America has seen a significant decline in civic participation during the last third of the twentieth century, especially in the 1980s and 1990s. Putnam included substantial statistical information to support his claim. One such table comprised of survey information from Roper Social and Political Trends surveys, 19731994, is entitled Trends in Political and Community Participation. On this table, Putnam shows the relative change during the twenty year period from 1973-74 to 199394 of community participation in several key areas that provide a reliable gage for measuring levels of civic engagement. For instance, those surveyed who said they had served as an officer of some club or organization was down 42% over this period. Likewise, the number of people claiming to have worked for a political party was down 42%. People who claimed to have served on a committee for some local organization were down 39%. Those people who had attended a 21 IMPROVING AMERICA'S COMMUNITIES POLICY PROPOSALS THAT INCREASE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND IMPROVE AMERICA'S BUILT ENVIRONMENT Bartley Matthews public meeting on town or school affairs were down 35%. Those who had written a congressman or senator were down 23%. And finally, those people claiming to have written a letter to the paper were down 14%. Putnam argued that "we Americans need to reconnect with one another" (Putnam, 2000). To draw further from the points made by both Duany and Putnam, I refer to a small experiment in an urban planning class at the University of Utah that illustrates why quality public spaces are needed to improve America's social capital and increase civic engagement. Professor Keith Bartholomew asked the students to observe how people tend to communicate with each other when passing one another face-to-face while walking on a sidewalk. Then, in contrast, Professor Bartholomew asked the class to reflect on how people tend to respond to others they pass while driving in the isolated comfort of a car. It was observed that the way in which people choose to react in each situation is markedly different. People are generally kinder and more cordial toward one another on the sidewalk where barriers that can isolate behavior are removed and their words and actions are exposed. When people are driving in the controlled environment of their own car, however, the students noted that their words and actions tend to be more cynical and critical of others (Bartholomew, 2006). A second example that articulates the disintegration of America's civic dialogue is occurring through the online, interactive, comment board on KSL Television's website--Salt Lake City's leading television station. When linking to each story at ksl.com the user has the option of posting a comment to express their point-of-view, or to just read the comments already posted by others. These relatively anonymous postings (showing aliases, or initials, or sometimes first names) reveal an alarming reality about our civic dialogue. Disappointingly, with the protection of anonymity, the majority of people that post comments on the board allow themselves to say just about anything (and they undoubtedly would say more if KSL did not censor some of their comments.) It is a rarity for someone to post a comment that adds any worthwhile substance to the conversation. Instead, the majority of postings are laced with outlandish criticisms, stinging phrases, and constant carping, not only as the comments address the story itself, but also, and possibly even more so, in the responses that participants post to one another. The cynical sentiment that prevails in the majority of these comments is overwhelming and such dialogue is not a recipe for productive social evolution. Therefore, the following question should be asked of the dialogue that occurs on KSL's comment board: would this same manner of exchange occur if these individuals were having this dialogue at the city library? Perhaps the answer to the question is yes; but if such is the case, then the response to that question is indeed a damning commentary on America's civic engagement of which Tocqueville would find little to praise. America's communities must reintroduce and increase the number of public environments that will provide for uplifting and productive interaction if healthy civic engagement is to increase. Putnam (2000) also argued that the many negative effects of suburban sprawl as verified through statistics and research. He argued that these homogeneous, suburban communities, which require continuous use of the automobile, have separated Americans in such a way that social interaction with neighbors and participation in community events has declined. For instance, Putnam wrote that between 1969 and 1995, while the average household size was decreasing, the number of cars per household doubled from one to two. Likewise, during this same time period the average commuting distance to work increased by 26% and the average commuting distance for shopping increased 29%. Putnam (2000) wrote: "Americans adults average seventy-two minutes every day behind the wheel, according to the Department of Transportation's Personal Transportation Survey. This is, according to time diary studies, more than we spend cooking or eating and more than twice as much as the average parent spends with the kids" (P. 212). Putnam continues by explaining that the car and commute hurt community life. He stated, "evidence suggests that each additional ten minutes in daily commuting time cuts involvement in community affairs by 10 percent" (Putnam, 2000). Thus, those who live in suburban communities are participating less and the social capital of their neighborhood is diminishing ultimately reducing their civic engagement (Putnam, 2000). A second essay by Barber titled Malled, Mauled, and Overhauled: Asserting Suburban Sprawl by Transforming Suburban Malls into Usable Civic Space addresses several additional issues pertaining to suburban sprawl and masterplanned communities. His essay focuses on two themes. First, the loss of our classic public spaces to redefined public spaces as developed in commercial centers and malls. Second, the attempt to create utopian societies through master-planned communities that lack genuine characteristics of community and democracy (Henaff, 2001). Countless examples of Barber's first point are found throughout America's suburban communities where, since the 1960s, and until recently, developers have built hundreds of enclosed malls. Intent on maximizing tenant sales, developers have designed enclosed malls to discourage key elements of civic engagement. Barber stated: "On entering an enclosed mall, we are asked to shed every identity other than that of the consumer. Eating is about buying fast food and moving back into the stream of shoppers; entertainment means buying Hollywood's latest and all the commodities that go with them; hanging out and peoplewatching are discouraged by security guards and, more important, the architecture is designed to impede sitting or standing around and keep the traffic flow moving into the shops" (Henaff, 2001). 22 HINCKLEY JOURNAL OF POLITICS 2007 Despite developers' efforts to make malls as profitable as possible, Barber indicated that their initial success is beginning to fail as consumers are becoming less attracted to the mall environment which is resulting in a downward shift of mall sales (Henaff, 2001). This has left the majority of mall developers in an uncomfortable, and more importantly, unprofitable situation leading several mall developers to begin researching ways to redevelop mall sites into profitable centers. In expounding his second point, Barber examined the master-planned community of Celebration, Florida, which was built in 1996 by the Disney Corporation. He criticized the Disney Corporation for the way in which they manipulate everyday life in Celebration. Barber stated: "The downside is not in what Disney does (which it often does very well), but in the totalizing nature of its ambitions" (Henaff, 2001). Celebration is not a community that has grown out of the cooperative associations of average people; rather, it is a development by a large corporation that influences everything from community design, to economy, schools, and government. Barber further argued that Celebration is an extension of the mall atmosphere wherein Disney has created a controlled environment with a captive audience to whom they may constantly market Disney products (Henaff, 2001). This is not an ideal model for future developers to follow. Nevertheless, there are several similarities between Disney's Celebration, Florida and Kennecott Land's Daybreak development in South Jordan, Utah. While Daybreak lacks what Barber identified as Disney's "let's-theme-park-the-world" attitude, Kennecott Land is implementing many of the characteristics that are found in the design of Celebration, Florida. It is now common for developers, like Disney and Kennecott Land, to contract architects and urban planning consultants who promote new urbanism ideals as reflected in the master-planned community. Unfortunately, however, these developers and designers can succumb to the desire to enshrine their master-planned community, for the foreseeable future, through establishment of codes, regulations, and restrictive covenants that run with the land making it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for any future property owners to make adjustments to the designer's initial plan. Daybreak is the first of approximately ten proposed master-planned communities that are being developed by Kennecott Land along the West Bench of the Salt Lake Valley at the base of the Oquirrh Mountain Range. Kennecott Land, formed in 2001, is a land development subsidiary of the Rio Tinto Group, an international mining conglomerate that owns Kennecott Utah Copper and the Bingham Canyon Copper Mine. Decades ago, Kennecott Utah Copper purchased the tract of land now being developed for potential mining that never materialized (History, Kennecott Land). Rather than continue to preserve this undeveloped tract of land, Kennecott Land was formed as a way to introduce new revenue for the company through land development, and to provide available land to help accommodate Utah's unprecedented population growth (expected to double from 2.2 million to 5 million by the year 2050). The Daybreak community is being developed within the jurisdiction of South Jordan, Utah, while the remaining communities will be developed in what is presently unincorporated Salt Lake County. Kennecott Land's completed development will cover an expanse of approximately ninety-three thousand acres, or one hundred forty-five square miles, which represents fifty-three percent of the developable land in the Salt Lake Valley. It is the largest metropolitan land-owning by anyone in the United States. Kennecott Land estimates that the West Bench development, to be completed by 2050, will consist of one hundred sixty-eight thousand residences that will house approximately four hundred fifty thousand people (Varella, 2005). If those projections are met, then Kennecott Land's West Bench development will dwarf Disney's twenty-thousand resident Celebration, Florida. Because Kennecott Land's West Bench development could affect nearly a half-million people it is imperative that masterplanning be done in such a way that it promotes civic engagement. While Kennecott Land's communities may be beautiful and functional, they appear to stifle civic engagement through the establishment of (1) community associations, or private governments; (2) restrictive covenants; and (3) the contracting of a professional, real estate, and management company, Capital Consultants Management Corporation of Dallas, Texas, who manages Daybreak and Celebration, Florida. Evidence of Kennecott Land's desire to assume control of the entire development of the Daybreak community is documented in a portfolio feature of Kennecott Land's Daybreak development that was published in Land Development by the National Association of Home Builders. It states, "Daybreak's rapid success is attributable to Kennecott Land's holistic approach to development of significantly large areas of property. What's more, the company's business model includes acting as a "master developer" of these large areas--that is, they design, plan, entitle, develop infrastructure, finance, and prepare design guidelines for their communities. They select and manage builders who share a commitment to excellence and Kennecott's design standards" (National Association of Home Builders, 2005). There are many people that prefer the privatization of government responsibilities and would welcome developers like Kennecott Land, who are willing to take on the entire development process, and relieve city planners of the need to address all of these details. Likewise, design firms will prefer developers like Kennecott Land because they will establish the restrictive covenants that will maintain their design for years. While there is merit to both of those arguments, I suggest that municipalities should not allow developers to establish restrictive covenants that dictate every detail of the com- 23 IMPROVING AMERICA'S COMMUNITIES POLICY PROPOSALS THAT INCREASE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND IMPROVE AMERICA'S BUILT ENVIRONMENT Bartley Matthews munity from the type of fences that people may have to the colors allowed on their houses. Such restrictive covenants may preserve the planners design, but are not healthy for civic engagement because they introduce elements of control that begin to lead down a slippery slope of limiting basic freedoms and liberties. An individual's community is a place that they can influence and shape. If restrictions are necessary, then let them be presented before the public for approval. Public involvement through democracy is what gives genuine feeling and character to a community. It is what makes a community born of the people that live in it. This occurs because each participant assumes a stake in the community's development. If the community succeeds or fails it will be a direct reflection of the people who live there. Establishing this type of policy makes it incumbent upon municipalities to educate their citizens about the need to incorporate new urbanism design. I am not referring to design details that dictate items like house color. Instead, I'm referring to new urbanism design principles that establish mixed-use development, safer streets, mass transit, and other similar and important design attributes. When properly informed, Americans make good decisions. They should be trusted by developers and planners to make such decisions in the development of their communities. PROPOSED SOLUTIONS TAX POLICY Many municipalities face significant difficulties when they try to implement policies that will improve their built environment without raising taxes. The pressure to provide all of the services and infrastructure that is necessary and demanded by a community's residents has driven municipalities to reevaluate their revenue sources. Municipalities derive revenue from three main categories: property taxes, fees, and local sales taxes (Wassmer, 2002). In many regions, municipalities are already collecting property taxes at the maximum allowed rate. This is especially true in California where the 1978 passage of Proposition 13 capped property taxes at one-percent for all property owners (Lewis, 2001). Raising property taxes is extremely unpopular and can lead to political suicide for any politician who recommends doing so. This creates a significant challenge for municipalities who are experiencing revenue shortfalls, especially since it is estimated that the property taxes collected on five residences are only sufficient to cover the costs associated with three (Bell, 2006). Likewise, municipalities are limited in the number of fees that they can levy. This leaves the sales tax as the last real possibility for municipalities that need to increase their revenue. Utah State Senator Gregory Bell explained that as municipalities continue to evaluate how they can increase their revenue, they "like all other entities, will follow the course of least resistance" (Bell, 2006). In determining what that course will be, municipalities compare and contrast their revenue sources with their expenditures to find the revenue that will provide the greatest fiscal outcome. This process is best described by the term fiscalization of land use, which is a term that was pioneered by D.J. Misczynski and refers to "local efforts to employ land-use regulation so as to increase local revenue streams" (Lewis, 2001, P. 24). It is reasonable, therefore, to understand why municipalities choose to court retail, since it can increase their local sales tax revenue. Robert W. Wassmer of California State University, Sacramento, explains in a recent journal article that municipalities generally prefer an increase in retail activity because "in most instances [it] requires a relatively small amount of local government services and generates relatively little environmental damage" (Wassmer, 2002). In Utah, the current sales tax system collects between 5.75% and 8% on every retail dollar spent. Four point seventy five percent of the tax returns to the state. One percent is reserved as the local option portion. The remaining 0% to 2.25% varies between municipalities where sales taxes have been increased to provide revenue for various county and town interests that relate to parks, highways, mass transit, hospitals, resorts, etc (Utah State Tax Commission, 2007). The 1% local option portion is evenly split with one half returning to the point-of-purchase and the other half being distributed pro-rata, statewide, based on population (Utah Code Section 59-12-204, 59-12-205). For example, if during the course of a year, Nordstrom, in Salt Lake City, sells $100 million worth of merchandise, then the state will collect $4.75 million, Salt Lake City will collect $500,000, and the remaining $500,000 will be dispersed equally to all municipalities, statewide, based on population. Utah is ahead of the curve to modify sales tax distribution by having already split the local option sales tax in this manner. Many states still return the full 1% local option sales tax to the point-of-purchase. Unfortunately, there is a limited amount of retail that can be supported by any one region or community. This leads municipalities to compete with one another to locate, within their jurisdiction, all of the possible retail that the region can support so that they may receive the half-percent local option sales tax revenue. Wassmer (2002) explained that "the greater the reliance on a municipal revenue source that generates a local fiscal surplus from local retail activity, the more likely it will be that local officials zone for retail land uses and utilize local incentives to encourage it" (Wassmer, 2002). The competition between municipalities to lure the limited retail from one municipality to the next has been referred to, by Senator Bell, as a cannibalization of cities that is harming the built environment, contributing to sprawl, and decreasing social capital. Senator Bell explained the consequences of this phenomenon, which are often referred to as zoning for dollars: "The financial incentive to create sprawl-type, auto-oriented, retail, facilities is very high. This often comes at the cost of losing established Main Street businesses and creating town gateways connecting the main part of town with free- 24 HINCKLEY JOURNAL OF POLITICS 2007 ways and major roads lined with big box retail, car lots and malls. The ambience and connectedness of the traditional town with its smaller scales and walkable facilities are usually sacrificed" (Bell, 2006). In order to return balance to community planning in municipalities, Senator Bell argued that the point-of-purchase benefit derived from the local option sales tax must be removed and redistributed based on some other criteria (Bell, 2006). That is the only way to redirect a municipality's focus from acquiring more and more retail to building walkable, safe, communities that endure. This proposal, however, is extremely unpopular among municipalities that have established significant retail in their jurisdictions. Wassmer stated "the political reality is that some jurisdictions have grown accustomed to the fiscal surplus generated by local land policies that favour retail activity and loathe losing it" (P. 1324). A second reason why municipalities resist further modifications to the sales tax structure is best explained by Paul G. Lewis (2001) of the Public Policy Institute of California in San Francisco. He stated "taking away local control over the sales tax in California, however, would place cities in the position of dependent claimants, fighting for yet another statecontrolled revenue source ? much the same position they are in now with respect to the property tax" (P. 31). The reality is that the local sales tax is the last source of revenue that municipalities can influence, shape, and structure to benefit their local situation. Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon each of the various stake holders to work to reform how these local option sales taxes are distributed. The manner in which the local sales tax system is currently constituted is broken and must be fixed if America's communities stand any chance of escaping the harmful effects of suburban sprawl. Until this change occurs, municipalities will have no incentive to implement new urban design measures to improve their communities. It is essential that action be taken immediately to curb this harmful trend. COMMUNITY ASSOCIATIONS UNDER THE AUSPICES OF MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT Throughout this article, I have argued against community associations that are established through the codes, policies, and covenants of master-planned communities. Among the many concerns of community associations, my greatest concern is that the members of these associations are often elected through substandard processes. Generally, community association elections embody little semblance of an official, municipal, election. Instead, these elections often utilize photocopied ballots and voting by proxy which subject the election to inaccurate results. Such elections do not typify republican democracy in its true form. If it is determined that a community association should be established in a master-planned community, provisions should be instituted to establish such an association under the auspices of the municipal government wherein the master- planned community is located. Organizing the community association in this way will not only establish a better structure to safeguard the association from failing to follow standard parliamentary procedure and provide adequate due process to the association's members, but it will also provide for a more fluid communication between the community association and city officials. An excellent example of the establishment of such associations is found in the twenty-three community councils located throughout Salt Lake City, Utah. These organizations are successfully increasing civic engagement while at the same time establishing a profound influence on city government. According to the city's website: "Salt Lake City recognizes neighborhood-based community organizations whose purpose is to provide community input and information to city departments. The community councils are encouraged to make recommendations to the city on all matters affecting the city or each organization's particular community or neighborhood. All City Council districts have community councils" (Community Councils, 2007). Although private management companies, which are contracted to assist community associations, guarantee aesthetically pleasing and functional communities through the continued enforcement of the designer's plan and restrictive covenants, the management companies and the community designers are taking away the deliberative citizen processes that shape communities. Such management companies are suitable for small developments but should not be allowed to manage the affairs of larger master-planned communities. REDEVELOPMENT Douglas Rae, a political scientist and member of the Yale faculty since 1967, left his chairmanship of Yale University's political science department in 1990 to serve for eighteen months as Chief Administrative Officer of New Haven, Connecticut. Rea recounted his experiences and observations while serving in New Haven's city government in his recent book City. The following quotation from Rae's book provides an excellent vision for future development of America's communities and built environment. Rae (2003) said, The old urbanism--the city of steam and manure--cannot be recaptured, and it would not suit our needs if it could be. But certain critical details of that older urbanism--the magic of small commitments to place, the value of strangers in ordinary life, the humanity of well-ordered sidewalks--must be among the principal guideposts to a new era of urbanism in the twenty-first century" (P. 31). Rae's vision for future development should be considered not only when establishing new development, but also in the redevelopment of America's decaying and sprawling neighborhoods. One such location is Valley Fair Mall in West Valley City, Utah. The mall is situated on a sixty-acre site that is located on Constitution Boulevard between 3500 and 25 IMPROVING AMERICA'S COMMUNITIES POLICY PROPOSALS THAT INCREASE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND IMPROVE AMERICA'S BUILT ENVIRONMENT Bartley Matthews 3800 South streets. The mall's construction was completed in 1970 during the era when many indoor suburban malls were built. Valley Fair Mall consists of forty-four acres of paved parking and six hundred thousand square feet, or fourteen acres, of retail space. Like most suburban malls, Valley Fair Mall is arguably West Valley City's most valuable land bank. At the time of its construction, Valley Fair Mall was located in the Granger neighborhood of Salt Lake County. In 1980, after two public votes, the residents of the Granger, Hunter, and Redwood neighborhoods successfully voted to incorporate the region into what is present day West Valley City (2007). West Valley City, as is the case with most suburban communities, does not have an urban center or recognized downtown. Therefore, I propose that West Valley City reverse the suburban trend and implement the policies that I am advocating by redeveloping Valley Fair Mall, and surrounding sites, into a new, central, eighty-acre downtown for West Valley City. The sites that I recommend for redevelopment include: Valley Fair Mall, Granger Elementary School, Granger Christian Church, Firestone Tires, Big O Tires, Jubilee Foods, Party City, and a small apartment complex. A possible name for the new development could be "Valley Fair Promenade: A Downtown for West Valley City." Unlike master-planned communities, multiple developers, under direction of the city, should be part of this venture, which, comprising eighty-acres is the equivalent of eight Salt Lake City blocks, or seventytwo Portland, Oregon blocks. If Utah's population projections remain accurate, then the state will need to redevelop locations like Valley Fair Mall in order to accommodate all of the anticipated growth. Hypothetically, this redevelopment could ultimately look like the following: it would have a downtown consisting of seventeen blocks that average three-hundred fifty feet in length. Such a configuration would be walkable while formatting well with the existing street pattern. One of the center blocks could be reserved for a park which would serve as a public gathering place and is an essential element for a successful downtown. On another central block, perhaps across from the park, could be a location for a new West Valley City Municipal Government Center. Another block adjacent to the park could be a site for a new Granger Christian Church. Granite School District could build a new Granger Elementary School on the same location as the existing school. West Valley City could invite KTVX channel 4 to locate in this new urban center where they would become more competitive with KUTV channel 2, which recently relocated to new Main Street in Salt Lake City. A small convention center could be built along with a new hotel. A new cinema, theater, office towers, condominiums, and mixed-use buildings would be encouraged. Light-rail service would also be brought to the location connecting West Valley City's urban center with other urban centers in the Salt Lake Valley. Certainly, the economy will determine whether a develop- ment of this magnitude could be supported, but the concept should at least be considered. An urban center redevelopment of this nature would have a positive influence in redefining West Valley City and the heart of Salt Lake Valley. At the same time, this new development would be a conglomerate of civic opportunity. What had once been a sixteen-acre mall with a forty-four acre parking lot would now be a thriving center of urban activity. West Valley City would become an attractive and desirable urban center. West Valley City would be recognized as a community built by people through multiple developers and a place where civic engagement flourishes. West Valley City would become another enduring installation of the American experience. CONCLUSION Thus far, America's experiment in democracy has proven to be an effective form of government which has given her citizens a voice in government while protecting their individual freedom. To ensure that America's experiment in democracy continues to flourish at the local level, government leaders and policy makers must curb the effects of suburban sprawl by implementing proven and effective urban design techniques that will establish public facilities that incite public participation and community involvement. Likewise, municipalities must discourage allowing developers to create an abstract form of community by establishing community associations that act in concert with professional master-planned community managers to create and enforce design criteria standards that limit the freedom of their citizens by insulati; Political Science, Political science literature, Periodicals.

Nature's Second Course: Water Culture in the Mormon Communities of Cache Valley, Utah, 1860-1916; Nineteenth-century Mormon settlers in Utah combined a unique set of religious beliefs with a fervent agrarianism and a strong sense of community. They encountered a specific arid environment along the Wasatch Front. A distinctive cultural set of irrigation institutions and practices developed out of the complex interchanges between nature and culture in Cache Valley, Utah, between 1860 and 1916. The structure of water flow, and conflicts over water rights and responsibilities, reflected the fundamental tensions within Mormon communities between individual gain and collective progress; it also reflected the patriarchal essence of Mormon culture. The season-to-season workings of irrigation institutions that distributed water from the Logan River, whether large irrigation districts or neighborhood canal cooperatives, showed how Mormon communities developed systems of exchange for water that allowed each individual irrigator to take water in direct proportion to the amount of labor, cash, or crops he contributed to the group's collective construction and upkeep of canals. The democratic nature of these exchanges, however, were tempered by natural hierarchies inherent in the geography of water canals, and by community hierarchies of power. A small group of elite town fathers held most of the responsibility for irrigation administration, and used their influence -in disputes over water. Those town fathers also tended to own more land than other irrigators. They often owned valuable land in proximity to the canals themselves. Between settlement in 1860 and the Call Decree in 1916, Logan River irrigators worked together to formulate a water distribution system that allowed for both the growth of local communities and for continued adherence to the basic religious principles on which the communities were founded. They also struggled to follow seasonal cycles of water use that fit within the natural cycles of the rise and fall of the water level in the river. Whether at the level of the high-line canal, the city block, or the family garden, Mormon water systems constituted an interesting example of the ways in which culture and the environment come together to shape natural resource use, especially in the arid regions of the American west.;  .
